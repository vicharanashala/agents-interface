Harvesting usually takes place from April to May."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the irrigation requirement for Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat crops generally require 4-6 irrigations, depending on soil type, weather, and rainfall. First irrigation must be provided in the crown root initiation stage (20-25 days after sowing). This stage is most critical, and the lack of water in this stage can cause poor root growth, leading to a significant drop in yield, and the first irrigation should be light to avoid damaging the roots. Second irrigation should be provided days after sowing during the tillering stage; irrigation during this period promotes a higher number of productive tillers. The third irrigation should be provided 60-65 days after sowing during the late jointing stage; irrigation during this stage is essential for stem development and nutrient uptake. Fourth irrigation should be provided 85-90 days after sowing during the flowering stage; water stress during this period leads to poor pollination and fewer grains per ear. The fifth irrigation should be provided 105-110 days after sowing during the milk stage. Adequate irrigation during this stage ensures proper grain size and weight, and if a sixth irrigation is available, you can provide it 130-135 days after sowing during the double dough stage. If 3 irrigations are available, provide irrigation at the most critical stages, such as CRI (20-25 days after sowing), flowering(85-90 days after sowing), and milk stage(105-110 days after sowing). If very limited water (1-2 irrigations) is available, then apply it in the CRI (20-25 days after sowing)stage, and if a second irrigation is possible, then in the milk stage(105-110 days after sowing). In some cases, a pre-sowing irrigation is needed to ensure effective germination, and always plan irrigation considering recent rainfall."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Is it good to spray in cloudy weather in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat is grown in the Rabi season because it needs cool weather for growth and dry conditions for maturity, which match the winter months. In the Kharif season, high temperatures and heavy monsoon rains are unsuitable for wheat cultivation. Avoid spraying in wheat during gloomy (cloudy) weather because high humidity and low sunlight reduce spray effectiveness and may cause disease spread or leaf burn. If needed, spray only when there is no rain forecast and conditions turn dry with mild sunlight. If spraying is urgently needed, mix a recommended surfactant or sticker with the pesticide so it sticks better to the leaves and gives improved results, and ensure no rain is forecast soon after."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the dose of Rifit in PR-112 Paddy variety?","Final Answer":"For PR-112 paddy, the pre-emergent herbicide Pretilachlor 50 EC (commonly known under the trade name Rifit) is used to control grasses, sedges, and broad-leaved weeds right after transplanting.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control para wilt in cotton?","Final Answer":"Parawilt is a physiological disorder of cotton. It is mainly seen after heavy rainfall or irrigation, especially in low-lying and poorly drained fields, and causes rapid drooping and wilting of leaves, and in severe cases, the entire plant dies. To manage this, ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging conditions in the field, do deep ploughing before sowing, avoid excessive irrigation in early stages, monitor for parawilt symptoms after heavy rainfall, and spray cobalt chloride (10 mg per litre of water) within 24-36 hours after symptom onset to reduce losses and improve recovery.\nSudden wilt or Fusarium wilt occurs in cotton due to the soil-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. This disease has similar symptoms to parawilt, such as rapid drooping and wilting of leaves, yellowing, and, in severe cases, death of the entire plant, but this disease is pathogenic, not just a physiological response, and it requires specific management strategies. To manage this, use Fusarium-wilt-resistant cotton hybrids such as DCH 32 and JG 32, avoid planting cotton in the same field repeatedly, do soil solarization before sowing, apply Trichoderma harzianum before sowing in soil, and ensure proper drainage in the field. In case of severe infection."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me the information regarding the water management in Wheat","Final Answer":"Water management in wheat is very important because timely irrigation gives a higher yield and saves water costs. Wheat needs 4\u20135 irrigations at critical stages generally, but you can go with up to 6 irrigations depending on the normal supply, adjusting intervals based on soil type and variety. Also, avoid overwaterlogging, as it may cause root rot. The first irrigation (crown root initiation) should be done around 20\u201325 days after sowing\u2014this is the most important stage for root and tiller growth. The next watering should be at the tillering stage, around 40-45 days after sowing. After that, you can give the third watering at the late jointing stage around 70-75 days after sowing, then a fourth at flowering time at 90-95 days after sowing for better flowering and yield, and finally, you can give a fifth irrigation at the dough stage around 110-115 days after sowing if the soil is very dry. The appropriate time to give the right irrigation is very important for better wheat growth and getting a better yield. To know the right time, just dig the soil 5-6 inches deep; if it feels dry and breaks easily, it's the right time to water. Always avoid giving too much water at once, as waterlogging can harm the roots. To save water, you should use laser land levelling and irrigate in the morning or evening to reduce evaporation loss and for better crop growth and yield. If the canal water is low, use a rain gun or sprinkler systems for uniform watering. Keep weeds under control or remove weeds properly from the field, as they consume extra moisture. By giving water only at critical stages and using efficient methods, farmers can get a good yield, save water, and reduce electricity\/diesel costs."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the best pre-emergence treatments for insect control in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is grown in the Rabi season because it needs cool weather for growth and dry conditions for maturity, which match the winter months. High temperatures and heavy monsoon rains in the Kharif season make it unsuitable for wheat cultivation. For effective pre-emergence insect control, the primary and most economical method is seed treatment. Treat seeds with Thiamethoxam 30 FS at 10 ml per kg of seed or Imidacloprid 48 FS at 5 ml per kg of seed to protect against soil pests like termites and aphids. Along with seed treatment, farmers should practice deep ploughing before sowing to expose and reduce soil pests like termites and cutworms. Applying neem cake at 250\u2013500 kg per acre during land preparation helps naturally repel soil insects and improve soil health. For chemical control during land preparation, use insecticides like Fipronil 0.3 GR at 7\u201310 kg per acre at the time of the last ploughing. Combining seed treatment with these cultural and chemical methods ensures healthy wheat growth and better yields."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Is PBW 621 successful in Punjab?","Final Answer":"PBW 621 wheat is a top and approved variety from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, fully suited for Punjab soil and weather. This variety is popular because it gives high yield, has good grain quality, and is resistant to many common wheat diseases like rust, which means less loss and better quality grain. It is a timely sown variety for the main wheat season, so the best sowing time is from 1st to 15th November, after harvesting paddy. Use 45 kg of seed per acre with a seed drill for proper plant stand, and always take seed from PAU seed farms, KVK, or government seed stores to ensure purity and good germination. PBW 621 matures in 140\u2013145 days, so you can harvest in April before the heat starts, and it gives about 20\u201322 quintals per acre under good management, and since the grain is bold and clean, it fetches a good price in the mandi. For best yield per acre, follow PAU\u2019s fertilizer dose: Nitrogen (N) 50 kg (about 110 kg urea)\u2014half at sowing and half at first irrigation (CRI stage, 20\u201325 days after sowing), Phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085) 25 kg (about 155 kg SSP or 55 kg DAP)\u2014full at sowing, and Potash (K\u2082O) 12 kg (about 20 kg MOP)\u2014full at sowing. If using DAP instead of SSP, adjust the urea so that the total nitrogen is correct. To get the full benefit, always prepare the field well after paddy, give the first irrigation at the crown root initiation stage (about 20\u201325 days after sowing), and keep the crop weed-free for the first 45 days for better growth.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Stem rot caused by Sclerotium oryzae in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a Kharif crop and is not generally grown in the Zaid\/Jayad season. In paddy (dhaan) crop, stem rot caused by Sclerotium oryzae mostly hits from late tillering to the maturity stage, especially in fields where water stands too long and extra nitrogen is given. You\u2019ll see the lower stems turning black and rotten, with white fungus and small mustard-like grains (sclerotia) inside. Affected plants lodge easily, and many grains stay empty. To stop it, first you can follow crop rotation with wheat or maize, don\u2019t overuse urea, and keep proper water management - if you see infection, drain water for 4\u20135 days. Choose PAU (Punjab Agriculture University) -recommended tolerant varieties like PR 126, PR 127, and PR 128 for better safety. For chemical control, you can foliar spray Validamycin 3% L @ 400 ml per acre or Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml in 200 litres of water per acre with a knapsack or power sprayer. As an alternative, you can use Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml\/acre \u2014 it also works well and is safe for paddy. Start the spray whenever you can see the first symptom. Make sure you cover the base of the tillers where the rot starts, keep a 10\u201312 day gap between sprays if repeat is needed, and always follow a 15-day PHI before harvesting. For eco-friendly and residue-free management, apply Trichoderma harzianum formulation @ 1 kg\/acre mixed with 50 kg well-decomposed FYM or vermicompost and broadcast in the field at puddling or transplanting. This beneficial fungus competes with the stem rot pathogen and reduces its survival in soil, giving long-term protection. Repeat once mid-season if field history shows high disease pressure. After harvest, remove and burn badly infected clumps so the fungus doesn\u2019t survive in the next crop. By using tolerant varieties, keeping the field well-drained, giving balanced fertilizer, and spraying the right chemical at the right time, you\u2019ll save your crop, protect your yield, and get good-quality grain that sells well in the mandi."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to use Ziam in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Ziam is a ready-mix fungicide containing Hexaconazole 4% + Zineb 68% WP, and it works very well against stem rot caused by Sclerotium oryzae, plus it also helps control sheath blight and other fungal problems. The benefit is double: Hexaconazole stops the fungus inside the plant, and Zineb protects the plant surface so the disease doesn\u2019t spread further. For stem rot, as soon as you see the first signs - black rotting at the stem base, white fungus growth, and mustard-like sclerotia - dissolve 300\u2013400 g Ziam per acre in about 200 litres of water and spray with a knapsack or power sprayer, ensuring the spray is directed at the base of the tillers. Cover the plants evenly, but don\u2019t spray in strong midday sun; early morning or late afternoon is best. If needed, repeat after 10\u201312 days, and always keep a 15-day PHI before harvesting for safe grain. In badly infected fields, drain out extra water for 4\u20135 days and avoid giving too much nitrogen, as stem rot loves wet, humid conditions. As an alternative, you can use other approved fungicides like Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml\/acre, Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml\/acre, or Validamycin 3% L @ 400 ml\/acre in 200 litres of water. For longer-term control, mix Trichoderma harzianum @ 1 kg\/acre with FYM and apply at puddling or transplanting to cut down fungus in the soil. By using Ziam or its alternatives on time, along with tolerant varieties like PR 126, PR 127, PR 128, proper water management, and removing old crop residue, you can keep stem rot under control, protect your yield, and get clean, good-quality grain for a better mandi rate."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What happens if too much 2,4-D is used on crops?","Final Answer":"Cotton (Kapas) crop, if 2,4-D herbicide is sprayed in overdose or its spray drifts from nearby wheat or sugarcane fields, it can badly damage the crop.  You will see leaves bending down, folding like a cup, stems bending or spiralling, flowers falling off, and plants staying small in severe cases, yield can fall a lot and may reduce profit. This is because 2,4-D is a very strong broadleaf weed killer, and cotton is extremely sensitive to it. That\u2019s why in cotton fields, 2,4-D is never recommended for weed control, and even if neighbours spray it, they should do it carefully to avoid drift towards your crop. If by mistake 2,4-D injury happens, apply irrigation promptly to dilute and wash out 2,4-D residues from the soil, as per PAU Weed Management. Avoid applying any more herbicides or strong pesticides until the crop comes back to normal. For safe weed control in cotton, you can use approved options like Pendimethalin 30% EC @ 1 litre\/acre in 200 litres water as pre-emergence within 2 days after sowing, or Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC @ 250 ml\/acre in 200 litres water for controlling grassy weeds in the standing crop. Both are safe for cotton when applied in the correct way. For Pendimethalin 30% EC @ PHI is not critical as it\u2019s applied before crop emergence, but for Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC, PHI is generally about 60 days.  If you follow PAU\u2019s weed management advice \u2014 pre-emergence spray plus one interculture \u2014 you can keep weeds in control without risking the crop. The right herbicide at the right dose will protect your yield and profit, but a single wrong spray of 2,4-D can spoil the hard work of the whole season."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Foot rot in Paddy?","Final Answer":"In the paddy (dhaan) crop,  Foot Rot (Bakane) disease can hit badly, especially in Basmati, if we don\u2019t manage it from the start. The best and safest way is to use the PAU-recommended biocontrol agent Trichoderma asperellum 2% WP \u2014 treat seed at 15 g per kg and before transplanting, dip seedling roots in a solution of 15 g per litre of water for about 6 hours. This eco-friendly method gives long-lasting protection, keeps soil healthy, and leaves no harmful residues. If chemical control is needed, treat seed with Carbendazim and Mancozeb ( 75 WS) (it's a combined mix) @ 2.5-3 grams per kg seed as a slurry, or spray at 500\u2013600 g per acre in 200 litres of water at the first sign of disease (applied only under expert guidance as carbendazim has some restrictions). As an alternative, Metalaxyl-M and Mancozeb (68 WP) @ 500 grams per acre in 200 litres of water can also be sprayed or used as a soil drench. For seed treatment, use Tebuconazole 2% DS @ 1 gram per kg seed (safer, effective, and within approved tolerance). As a safer and modern alternative, you can use a combined fungicide like 75 WG, with 50%  Tebuconazole and 25% Trifloxystrobin, 80 grams per acre in 200 litres of water for foliar spraying. Always maintain a PHI of 30\u201335 days after the last chemical spray before harvest for safe grain, but always follow the PHI level. Along with this, follow cultural practices \u2014 transplant in the second fortnight of July, keep fields well-drained to avoid standing water, avoid excess nitrogen, remove and destroy infected seedlings, and rotate with crops like wheat or maize to break the disease cycle.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the best number of cotton pickings?","Final Answer":"Cotton (kapas) crop, the best is to do  2\u20133 pickings at a gap of 15\u201320 days. This way you can collect most of the kapas clean and dry, without letting it fall on the ground. Usually, about 85% of the crop comes in the first two to three pickings, which doesn\u2019t pay back the extra labour expense. Picking starts around mid-September and goes on till November, and it\u2019s best to do it on bright sunny days when the bolls are fully open and the fibre is fluffy and dry. While picking, handle kapas gently so the fibre stays clean and undamaged. Keep kapas in a dry, airy place and never store it in damp spots like near water channels. Always keep different varieties separately to get the best market price. Before taking to market, clean the kapas well for better rates. After the final picking, remove and destroy cotton sticks immediately \u2014 either burn them or bury them deep \u2014 to reduce carryover of pests and diseases. For the best yield and quality, plant recommended varieties like Suraksha, Kamal, RST-9, Bunny Bt, and J34 (as these varieties are a bit outdated, try to use another two for better results). For pest control, you can use approved insecticides like Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 60 ml in 200 litres of water per acre for sucking pests, and Emamectin benzoate 5% SG at 80-100 grams per acre mixed in about 200 litres of water for bollworms, following the label instructions, with a Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 14 days.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Bathua weed(Chenopodium album) in Wheat field?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a strict Rabi crop and is never grown in the warm, humid Kharif monsoon. In wheat fields, Bathua (Chenopodium album) is a big headache, so the best is to hit it with chemical, cultural, and biological ways together for full control. After sowing, within 2\u20133 days, spray Pendimethalin 30 EC @ 1 litre per acre in 200 litres of water to stop early weed germination. If Bathua comes later, at 25\u201330 days crop stage (3\u20135 leaf stage), spray Sulfosulfuron 75% WG @ 13.5 gram per acre or Metsulfuron-methyl 20% WP @ 8 gram per acre in 150\u2013200 litres of water, for mixed weeds like Bathua and grassy weeds (Mandusi), one ready-combined mix spray of (commonly Sulfosulfuron 75% and Metsulfuron-methyl 5% WG) 16 gram per acre mixed in 150 to 200 liters of water for uniform spraying, works best and is cheaper. This dose controls both broadleaf and grassy weeds efficiently when applied at the early 3-5 leaf stage of wheat. As an alternative, you can use  Clodinafop-propargyl 15% WP and Metsulfuron-methyl 5% WP premix used as a post-emergence herbicide for grassy weed control. The typical recommended dose is approximately 30 grams per acre, mixed in 150-200 liters of water. Both these chemical controls should be applied carefully following label instructions for the best and safest weed management. Maintain a Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 30 days after herbicide application to ensure food safety.  For cultural control, do hand weeding when weeds are small, keep a good seed rate and proper crop spacing, and avoid using Bathua-infested manure. For biological control, use Trichoderma or bio-herbicide formulations at 2 kg can be mixed in about 200 to 300 liters of water per acre and applied to the soil, especially before or at the time of sowing. This helps suppress weed seed germination and soil-borne pathogens over time, or foliar spray use  3 grams in 200 liters of water per acre. Spray chemicals early morning or late evening for best effect, rotate herbicides to avoid resistance, and always buy from authorized dealers.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Patta lapet (Leaf folder) in Rice?","Final Answer":"Rice leaf folder-infected leaves show folded leaves with white streaks where the green tissue has been scraped off, and reduced leaf photosynthesis. To control rice leaf folder (patta lepatek), an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical control measures is recommended. Avoid sowing in shade, do not use excessive nitrogen fertilizer, maintain water levels up to 3 inches in the field for 25 days after transplanting, collect and destroy folded leaves, and encourage natural enemies like spiders, Trichogramma spp. For mechanical control, before flowering, drag a 20\u201330 m long coir or jute rope forward and backwards over the crop canopy while water is standing in the field. This dislodges larvae from folded leaves.  Spray insecticides when 2-3 folded leaves per plant are observed during the critical period of August -October. PAU recommended insecticides to control leaf folder are Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre diluted in 150-200 litres of water or Flubendiamide 39.35% SC @ 20 ml\/acre in 100 litres of water. Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance and long-term effectiveness."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Para wilt\/Sudden wilt in Cotton?","Final Answer":"Parawilt is a physiological disorder of cotton. It is mainly seen after heavy rainfall or irrigation, especially in low-lying and poorly drained fields, and causes rapid drooping and wilting of leaves, and in severe cases, the entire plant dies. To manage this, ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging conditions in the field, do deep ploughing before sowing, avoid excessive irrigation in early stages, monitor for parawilt symptoms after heavy rainfall, and spray cobalt chloride (10 mg per litre of water) within 24-36 hours after symptom onset to reduce losses and improve recovery.\nSudden wilt or Fusarium wilt occurs in cotton due to the soil-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. This disease has similar symptoms to parawilt, such as rapid drooping and wilting of leaves, yellowing, and, in severe cases, death of the entire plant, but this disease is pathogenic, not just a physiological response, and it requires specific management strategies. To manage this, use Fusarium-wilt-resistant cotton hybrids such as DCH 32 and JG 32, avoid planting cotton in the same field repeatedly, do soil solarisation before sowing, apply Trichoderma harzianum before sowing in soil, and ensure proper drainage in the field. In case of severe infection, drench the soil around the base of infected plants with Copper Oxychloride 50 WP @ 3 grams per litre of water, or Hexaconazole 5 SC @ 1-2 ml per litre of water."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control fungal diseases?","Final Answer":"The most important fungal diseases of wheat are yellow rust(stripe rust), leaf rust, stem rust, powdery mildew, and loose smut. If you see yellow-orange streaks on leaves during mid-December to March under cool, humid conditions, it may be due to yellow rust, and it reduces photosynthesis, which causes yield loss. If you see reddish brown spots in leaves, it may be due to leaf rust, and if you find reddish black spots in stems, it may be due to stem rust disease. If white or grey powdery fungal patches appear during humid conditions on the upper side of leaves, it may be due to powdery mildew disease, and if black powdery masses are seen in spikelets instead of grain, it is due to loose smut disease. It is important to manage fungal diseases to reduce yield loss and maximize profit. To control fungal diseases in wheat, consult local agricultural extension worker or KVKs to select wheat varieties that are resistant and tolerant to rust, powdery mildew, and smut, treat seeds with carboxin or thiram before sowing(2-3 gram per kg of seed), especially to control loose smut diseases, avoid overhead irrigation and waterlogging conditions, and practice crop rotation.  To control all type of rust and powdery mildew in wheat spray fungicides like Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200-250 per acre diluted in 200-250 litres water, applied at tillering and early jointing stage only, or Captan 70% + Hexaconazole 5% WP @ 300 grams per acre in 200 litres of water, or Trifloxystrobin 25% + Tebuconazole 50% SC @ 200-250 ml diluted in 200-300 litres of water during tillering to flowering stage and repeat it if the symptoms persist. Additionally, you can apply sulphur-based fungicide @ 1 kg per acre in 200 litres of water to control powdery mildew. It is recommended not to apply fungicides in wheat after flag leaf emergence."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Mealybug?","Final Answer":"Cotton mealybug causes white cottony growth on shoots and leaves, yellow leaves, sooty mould growth on leaves and stunted plant growth. To control mealybug in cotton, an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological and chemical methods is recommended. Remove alternate weed hosts like Parthenium around cotton fields, avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertiliser, ensure proper irrigation and fertiliser application, and use Verticillium lecanii or Beauveria bassiana as a foliar spray during humid conditions. Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings and spiders. In case of heavy infestations or if you see 1 or more mealybug colonies per plant, a chemical insecticide spray is recommended. The recommended insecticides to control mealybug in cotton are: Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 60-80 ml per acre diluted in 200 litres of water, or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40-60 grams diluted in 200 litres of water or Buprofezin 25 SC @ 400 ml in 200 litres of water and repeat @10-12 day intervals if symptoms persist. It is recommended to rotate fungicides to prevent resistance and add a sticker or spreader along with insecticides during spraying."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Thrips?","Final Answer":"Thrips cause leaf curling, poor ball formation, and plant growth in cotton crops, and they are active during the early seedling stage (first 30-45 days after sowing), so early detection and control measures are necessary. To control thrips in cotton, avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer, maintain proper plant spacing, regularly remove weeds in and around the cotton fields, install yellow sticky traps (8 per acre), and apply neem oil 20% (20 ml per litre of water). If 50% of the plants show the initial symptoms of leaf curling on the upper leaves, the insecticide spray is recommended. The recommended insecticides are: Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 40-60 ml per acre mixed in 200 litres of water, or Spinosad 45 SC @ 65-80 ml per acre mixed in 200 litres, or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 grams per acre in 200 litres of water. Always rotate insecticides to prevent resistance, and the spray should be done during early morning or late afternoon.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Yellow Ear Rot and Ear Cockle disease of Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is strictly grown as a Rabi crop and is never grown in the warm, humid Kharif season. If you see bright yellow, sticky liquid oozing from ear heads, stems, and leaves, along with twisted and distorted ear heads and no grain formation inside, it may be due to yellow ear head (Tundu) disease. If you notice twisted, wrinkled leaves and black or brown galls inside the ear instead of normal wheat kernels, it is due to ear cockle disease (mamni). Both diseases make the wheat heads look unhealthy, with distorted ears and infected grains, leading to lower yield. To control this, use certified disease-free seed and treat seeds by soaking them in hot water at 54\u201356 \u00b0C for 10\u201312 minutes to kill the nematodes inside the galls, or in a 2% salt solution. In this process, healthy, heavy seeds will sink, while the lighter nematode galls and debris will float and can be destroyed. It is recommended to wash the seeds thoroughly with water and dry them before sowing."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Cotton boll cracking?","Final Answer":"Boll cracking is seen in cotton, which may be due to pest attack, such as pink bollworm, which bores larvae into cotton bolls, irregular watering, or nutrient imbalances. The damage can cause premature ball opening or cracking and expose fibre and seeds to pests, diseases, and adverse weather, leading to reduced yield and fibre quality. To control this, sowing should be done at the recommended time(April to mid-May), apply a balanced fertilizer dose based on soil test recommendations, irrigate at critical stages, especially during flowering and boll development stage, avoid waterlogging situations, use Bt cotton and resistant varieties against bollworm, and remove and destroy infected cotton crop residue to reduce bollworm population."}

Farmers should always source seeds from official, certified suppliers and avoid outdated varieties to maximize yield and minimize pest damage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much dose is recommended for Monocil for controlling Stem Borer in Paddy?","Final Answer":"The stem borer is one of the most destructive pests of paddy. It is the larva (caterpillar) of a moth. The larva bores into the stem of the paddy plant and feeds on the inner tissues. If the attack occurs during the vegetative stage (before flowering), the central shoot of the plant turns yellow and dies, creating a \"dead heart\" that can be easily pulled out. If the attack occurs during the reproductive stage (after flowering), the panicle (the grain-bearing part) turns white and chaffy, containing no grain. This is called a \"white earhead. The use of Monocrotophos for paddy or vegetables is banned by the government of India due to its extremely high toxicity to humans, birds, and the environment. Therefore, you should NOT use Monosil or any other brand of Monocrotophos on your paddy crop. Here are some alternates you can use: Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 80ml per acre in 120-200 litres of water, or Fipronil @ 200-300 ml per acre, or Flubendiamide 20% WG @ 50 g per acre, or Cartap Hydrochloride 50% SP @ 400g per acre in 200 liters of water. Always spray in the morning or evening to avoid evaporation and better results. Rotate Insecticides to prevent the development of resistance.

Under such conditions, PBW 752 yields around 19.2 quintals per acre, PBW 771 about 19.0 quintals per acre, and PBW 757 about 15.8 quintals per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control weeds in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a Rabi crop, sown between October and December and harvested from February to May. Weeds such as Phalaris minor, Avena fatua, Poa annua (grassy weeds), and Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, and Billi buti (broadleaf weeds) can significantly reduce yields. To manage these, remove crop residues and debris before planting, practice crop rotation with pulses to break weed cycles, and ensure wheat seeds are clean and free from weed seeds. For controlling Phalaris minor resistant to isoproturon, use Clodinafop-propargyl at 60 g active ingredient (about 120 ml of 15% EC) per acre, or Sulfosulfuron at 25 g active ingredient (around 50 g of 25% WG) per acre, applied post-emergence when weeds are at the 2\u20133 leaf stage. To control broadleaf weeds such as Anagallis arvensis and Chenopodium album, apply Metsulfuron-methyl at 4 g active ingredient (about 4 g of 70% WG) per acre, or 2,4-D at 500 ml per acre, depending on the formulation. A modern, cost-effective option is a broad-spectrum ready-mix herbicide combining Sulfosulfuron + Metsulfuron-methyl (e.g., 30 g + 4 g per acre), which controls both grassy and broadleaf weeds in a single spray. Apply pre-emergence herbicides soon after sowing to prevent weed germination, and post-emergence herbicides when weeds are young. Manual weeding can supplement chemical control if sprays are delayed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Aphids?","Final Answer":"No, wheat is not cultivated in the Kharif season. Wheat is a Rabi crop, sown in late October to November and harvested from March to April. Aphids are common pests in wheat that suck sap from leaves and stems, causing yellowing and reduced growth. To control aphids in wheat, spray insecticides such as Imidacloprid at 100 ml per acre or Thiamethoxam at 50\u201360 grams per acre, mixed in 200\u2013300 liters of water. Apply when aphid numbers reach 5\u201310 per tiller. Spray in the early morning or late evening to protect beneficial insects. Always observe a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 21 days before harvesting to ensure safe residue levels."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide some information about the HKR-47 and HKR-127 varieties?","Final Answer":"HKR-47 and HKR-127 are primarily considered Kharif rice varieties, meaning they are sown during the monsoon season and harvested in autumn. HKR-47 and HKR-127 are non-scented rice varieties developed by Haryana Agricultural University (HAU). They are known for their high yield potential and suitability for various growing conditions. Farmers sometimes grow HKR-47 and HKR-127 rice, despite local university recommendations for other varieties like PR 126 or PR 121. HKR-47 offers high yield (around 32 quintals per acre) and matures in roughly 135 days. It's known for good tillering, moderate blast resistance, and drought\/waterlogging tolerance, but is susceptible to Bacterial Blight (BB). HKR-127 is a high-yielding (up to 30 qt per acre) and matures in 135-140 days. It's resistant to stem rot and WBPH, moderately resistant to BB, and tolerant to lodging and blast."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control insects in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is affected by several insect pests that can significantly reduce yield and grain quality if not properly managed. Key pests include termites, aphids, armyworms, and shootflies. Termites attack seeds and roots, particularly in dry, organic-rich soils, and can be effectively controlled through seed treatment with Fipronil 5% SC at 6\u20138 ml\/kg of seed. Aphids suck sap from leaves and earheads, weakening the plant and reducing grain filling. They can be managed by spraying Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 0.25 g\/liter (PHI: 14 days) or Flonicamid 50 WG at 0.3 g\/liter (PHI: 7\u201314 days). Armyworms, which feed on leaves and earheads at night, are controlled using Emamectin Benzoate 5 SG at 0.4 g\/liter (PHI: 10\u201314 days) or Lambda-Cyhalothrin 5 EC at 1 ml\/liter (PHI: 7\u201314 days). Shootflies damage seedlings by causing dead hearts and are best managed through early sowing, resistant varieties, and cultural practices, as chemical control is not commonly recommended. Integrated Pest Management (IPM), including timely sowing, proper spacing, crop rotation, and the use of bioagents like Trichogramma spp., is essential for long-term pest control and for reducing dependence on chemical pesticides."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to increase ripening in Cotton?","Final Answer":"Cotton ripening can be effectively managed using specialised plant growth regulators\u2014primarily Ethephon (Ethrel) and Thidiazuron (TDZ) -which promote earlier boll opening, defoliation, and improved harvest efficiency. Ethephon works by releasing ethylene upon application, inducing uniform boll opening and aiding defoliation when most bolls are mature (45+ days old) and temperatures exceed 20 \u00b0C, with optimal harvest aid effectiveness occurring 10\u201315 days post-application. Combining TDZ (20g\/acre) with Ethephon (90g\/acre) enhances this effect while balancing cost."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How should I treat rice seeds before sowing?","Final Answer":"While the Zaid (summer) season (March to June) is typically suitable for short-duration vegetables and fodder crops, paddy is generally grown in the Kharif (monsoon) season. However, if paddy is grown during the Zaid season, particularly for seed purposes or for early transplanting in the subsequent Kharif season, proper seed treatment is crucial. Seed treatment helps to: Protect seeds from seed-borne and soil-borne diseases. Enhance germination and promote healthy seedling growth. Improve resistance to specific diseases and pests. Boost seedling vigor and establishment in the field. Seed treatment - Trichoderma asperellum (biocontrol agent): Apply @ 10 g per kg of seed. Alternatively, dip seedlings in a Trichoderma solution (10 g per litre of water) before transplanting to enhance protection against disease (particularly in basmati rice varieties to manage foot rot). Chemical treatment: Tebuconazole 2% DS at a dose of 1 g per kg of seed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control swank weed (Barnyard) in Paddy?","Final Answer":"\u201cSwank\u201d refers to barnyard grass, a major weed in Paddy (Rice) cultivation. It\u2019s particularly problematic in direct-sown paddy fields, where it competes aggressively with rice for nutrients, water, and light. Reduces yield, competes with rice, hard to control.(IWM) Cultural practices - Rotate with non-rice crops like maize or vegetables to break weed cycles. Mechanical control - rotary weeder: Use between 15-30 days after transplanting to uproot weeds, Hand weeding: At 20\u201325 days and again at 40\u201345 days. Chemical control - spray pre-emergence herbicide (Butachlor 50 EC - 1.25 liters in 200 L water in apply 15-25days after transplanting), Spray post emergence herbicides - (Bispyribac sodium 10 SC - 100 ml in 150\u2013200 L water apply  3-5 days after transplanting).

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the common name of Boerhavia diffusa?","Final Answer":"The common name of Boerhavia diffusa is \u201cPunarnava\u201d. It often grows as a wild weed in and around paddy crops. To manage it, start with good field preparation by removing weeds before transplanting or sowing. You can use pre-emergence herbicides like Pendimethalin 30 EC at 1 litre per acre within 2\u20133 days after sowing\/transplanting to prevent its growth. For established weeds, use post-emergence herbicides like Bispyribac-sodium 10 SC at 80-120 ml per acre within 10-14 days of transplanting and for direct sowing within 15- 25 days. Pre-harvest interval: Do not harvest for 60 days after Pendimethalin and 30 days after Bispyribac-sodium application. Keep this in mind to ensure safe, residue-free paddy."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I stop water in my field?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the kharif season because it requires plenty of water and warm temperatures, which are available during the monsoon. The zaid season is too hot and dry with insufficient rainfall, making it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. In paddy cultivation, bunds (raised field boundaries) play a crucial role in maintaining the standing water necessary for optimum crop growth. These bunds act as small embankments that hold water within the paddy field, ensuring consistent water depth for seedling establishment, weed control, and nutrient availability. In paddy cultivation, stopping or managing water in the field depends on the growth stage and the water management technique used, but some general principles apply. In the nursery stage of paddy, maintain about 2-3 cm of standing water to keep the soil moist and support healthy seedling growth. Avoid deep flooding to prevent root damage and diseases. Once seedlings are ready for transplanting, maintain 3-5 cm of water in the main field after transplanting, and drain water completely 10-15 days before harvest."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of Caldan?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the kharif season because it requires plenty of water and warm temperatures, which are available during the monsoon.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Jhanda rog (Bakanae disease) in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Controlling Bakanae disease (also known as \"Jhanda Rog\") in paddy is an integrated process, with a strong focus on prevention through seed and seedling treatment. The disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium fujikuroi, is first visible in the nursery and becomes more apparent in the main field. The key symptoms are: The most characteristic symptom is the unusual elongation of seedlings that become much taller than the healthy plants in the same field. Thin Stems and Pale Leaves: Infected plants are often thin, weak, and have pale green leaves. The base of the stem often develops adventitious (extra) roots just above the ground level. As the disease progresses, the base of the plant stem rots, leading to the death of the plant. To control this disease, do seed treatment with Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 2 g per kg of seeds. Or for a high level of protection, a root dip treatment is highly recommended before transplanting in Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP @ 2 gm per litre of water, Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 1 g per litre of water. Or you can use biocontrol agents such as Trichoderma viride or Trichoderma harzianum @ 4-5 grams per kg of seed for seed treatment. PAU and other research institutions emphasize that a seedling root dip (dipping the roots in a fungicide solution before transplanting) is more effective than just a seed treatment."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage ear cockle problem in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Ear cockle in wheat is a disease caused by the nematode Anguina tritici. It's characterized by the formation of galls (also called cockles or seed galls) on wheat ears, which replace normal kernels. These galls are hard, dark, and contain nematode larvae. The disease can significantly reduce yield and grain quality. Effective management strategies include using clean, certified seeds, practicing crop rotation, and using hot water seed treatment to kill the nematodes. For hot water seed treatment, put the seeds in hot water at a temperature of 54-56\u00b0C for 10-12 minutes to kill nematodes."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me with the information about the hardening of Paddy seedlings?","Final Answer":"If you want your paddy seedlings to be strong and ready for the field, the best and simplest way is to harden them before transplanting. First, soak your seed in 1% Calcium Chloride (CaCl\u2082) solution for about 12 hours using 100\u2013150 mL of CaCl\u2082 in 10 litres of water-enough for one acre of seed quantity. This makes seedlings tough, improves sprouting, and helps them handle dry or hot conditions.  After soaking, dry the seed back to its normal moisture in shade, then sow in well-prepared, well-drained nursery beds. As an alternative, you can soak in 1% Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083) or 1% Potassium Chloride (KCl) the same way, about 100 to 150 ml of KNO\u2083 or KCl per 10 liters of water, enough to soak seeds for one acre. For a natural option, you can use Panchakavya 3% (Mix 3 liters of Panchakavya in 100 liters of water) For seed soaking or dipping seedlings before transplanting, soak for about 20 minutes or 10% cow dung water (Mix 10 liters of fresh, well-decomposed cow dung in 100 liters of water) Use it for seed soaking or nursery spraying as needed. Both these natural treatments help improve seedling vigor, root growth, and resistance naturally. In the nursery, apply 25 kg urea + 60 kg SSP + 40 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21% Zn) per acre at sowing, then another 25 kg urea per acre after 15 days. Keep the nursery weed-free and give only light water; about 5\u20137 days before transplanting, reduce water so the soil top dries a bit\u2014this \u201cdrying\u201d step makes roots strong and cuts down transplant shock. Always use healthy seeds, keep seedlings 25\u201330 days old for transplanting, and follow PHI of 14\u201321 days for any chemical seed treatments like Cruiser 70 WS @ 1 g\/kg seed or Raxil Easy 6 FS @ 13 ml\/40 kg seed. This mix of seed soaking, good nursery care, and gradual hardening is tested by PAU and farmers here-it saves seedlings from stress, helps them settle fast in the field, and finally gives you more yield and profit."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you give me the information about water leaching in Paddy?","Final Answer":"In paddy fields, water leaching is very important to keep the soil healthy and prevent salt or chemical build-up that can harm seedlings and reduce yield.  Paddy needs about 1300 to 1500 mm of water per crop cycle, which mostly comes from irrigation because rainfall is less here. To do proper water leaching, after puddling and transplanting, keep about 5\u20137 cm (2\u20133 inches) of standing water, let it soak in, and once the field dries on top, flood again. Doing this every 2\u20134 days flushes salts down and gives fresh water to the roots. This helps flush out salts and unwanted chemicals from the root zone.  Use flood irrigation, but avoid keeping water stagnant for too long, as it causes nutrient loss and poor root growth. For saving water and still getting good leaching, you can use Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) \u2014 put 5 cm of water only when small cracks start showing in the soil. Always keep your field well-leveled with laser leveling so water spreads evenly. Short-duration, PAU-approved varieties like PR-126, PR-121, and PUSA-44 fit well with this schedule and need less water. Remove weeds early so they don\u2019t steal water from your crop. If you want to boost soil health, mix Trichoderma @ 2 kg per acre in 200\u2013300 litres of water during land prep \u2014 it helps roots grow stronger and improves nutrient use. This tested practice saves water, keeps salts low, and gives a healthy crop with better yield and profit."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control white flies in cotton?","Final Answer":"Whiteflies \u2014 which are commonly called white mosquitoes \u2014 are a big problem. They suck the sap from leaves, making them yellow, curled, and weak, and even cause flowers and small bolls to drop. This directly cuts your yield and quality. The best way to manage them is by using a mix of good field hygiene, timely sprays, and natural control. First, keep your field clean \u2014 remove weeds and nearby host crops like moong, okra, and even avoid planting cotton near vegetables or kinnow orchards, because these harbour whiteflies. After harvest, plough and destroy crop residues so pests can\u2019t survive for next season. At the very first sign of whiteflies, spray PAU-approved insecticides such as Thiacloprid 21.7% SL @ 300 ml per acre or Acetamiprid 20 SP @ 100\u2013150 grams per acre mixed in 200 litres of water. As an alternative and for rotation, you can also use  Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 75 ml per acre in 200 litres of water, to ensure full coverage. Spray in the early morning or late evening for the best effect and keep a PHI of 14 days before picking cotton. For a safer option, use Neem oil @ 5 ml per litre or release Trichogramma egg parasitoids around 60,000 per acre to attack the pest naturally, and put up yellow sticky traps to catch adults, at weekly intervals during the pest season, typically starting early July until October. Releases are usually done 6 times, at 7-10 day gaps, to cover successive generations of whiteflies. This ensures good parasitism of whitefly eggs and reduces pest population naturally. Always rotate insecticides from different chemical groups to prevent resistance, and repeat sprays every 10\u201315 days if needed. Choose recommended varieties like Punjab Cotton 140 and RS 2013, which have good yield and some tolerance. This integrated method \u2014 clean field, right chemical at the right time, and bio-control \u2014 will keep whiteflies under check, protect your kapas, and give you better returns in the mandi."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which chemical should I use for dipping seedlings of Rice before transplanting?","Final Answer":"For paddy cultivation, dipping seedlings before transplanting is a common practice to protect them from diseases and pests.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to manage lodging in Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) due to excessive Nitrogen?","Final Answer":"Lodging due to excessive nitrogen application in Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) is a serious problem. If you apply excessive nitrogen, which can stimulate excessive vegetative growth, causing taller plants with weaker stems, making the plant more vulnerable to falling over or lodging, this situation is worsened during strong winds and heavy rainfall. To control this, use lodging resistance varieties with short stature and thick stems, such as PR 126, PR 121, and PAU 201; prefer the hill seeding method rather than broadcasting; and ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test results, especially potassium and phosphorus, to strengthen stems. Apply about 70-105 kg of urea per acre in three split doses in DSR rice. First, apply urea at 21-42 kg per acre as basal during sowing. Second, apply urea at 21-42 kg per acre after 20-25 days of sowing as topdressing, and apply the remaining 21-42 kg of urea per acre during the panicle initiation stage (40-45 days after sowing). Use the PAU leaf color chart (LCC) to monitor N and apply only when the youngest fully expanded leaf is paler than the critical LCC value (4 for most varieties, 3 for light-green types). Additionally, you can apply Paclobutrazol at 120-160 grams per acre diluted in 200-300 liters of water at 15-20 days after sowing near the plant base, or a foliar spray of 3 grams of Paclobutrazol in 100 liters of water during the tillering stage is effective to reduce plant height, strengthen the stem, and reduce lodging risk."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What fertilizers should I use in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Before applying any fertilizer, it is highly recommended to do a soil test, which helps in avoiding deficiencies and prevents the unnecessary and costly over-application of nutrients. The recommended fertilizer dose for irrigated conditions: Generally, 110 kg urea, 55 kg DAP or 155 Kg SSP, and 20-40 kg MOP per acre is required(if soil is potassium deficient). Apply the full dose of phosphorus and potassium at sowing as basal fertilizers. Split the nitrogen dose into two: half at sowing and half applied later at the time of irrigation, typically first and second irrigation. If your soil has high phosphorus content, you can reduce the DAP dose, and if wheat is sown after December, reduce the urea dose. In micronutrient-deficient soil, apply zinc sulphate 10 kg per acre and borax 2 kg per acre based on soil testing. In rainfed areas, the recommended doses of fertilizers are: 70 kg urea,100 kg SSP, and if the soil is potassium deficient, apply 20 kg MOP. Half urea, along with full SSP and MOP, should be applied during sowing, and the remaining urea should be applied after winter rain."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the ideal time for the second irrigation?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a cool-season crop.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What causes wilting in cotton and how can it be managed?","Final Answer":"Cotton is a Kharif crop, it\u2019s sown in April\u2013May just before the monsoon and harvested in October\u2013November. The drying of cotton occurs due to Physiological Wilt (Parawilt) in which the plants appear wilted, leaves show chlorosis turning bronze or red, immature bolls open prematurely, yet plants may partially recover later.  The causes are sudden changes in soil, often after flooding or waterlogging in heat, that damage roots and reduce water uptake. \n\nAs para wilt is a physiological disorder, the affected plants can be saved by spraying cobalt chloride @ 10 mg per litre of water (10 ppm) immediately after the appearance of symptoms. \n\nTo control Fusarium wilt,  Copper oxychloride (3 g\/L water), 600 g in 200 litres of water, drenching with fungicide around the base of affected plants is necessary. A pre-harvest interval of 14 days is needed to avoid contamination."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the causes of stunted growth in cotton and how can farmers manage them?","Final Answer":"Stunting and poor growth in cotton are observed due to many reasons. Some of them are soil & moisture stress, which causes poor germination or stunted growth, often happens if the soil crusts, has low moisture, or is waterlogged. It can be corrected by maintaining optimum moisture, breaking the surface crust with a light hoeing to improve aeration. Another reason is nutrient deficiency, which causes low nitrogen or zinc deficiency and can cause slow growth. The solution is a foliar spray of 2% urea (20 g\/L water) prepared by mixing  4 kg of urea in 200 litres of water for an acre, and spraying evenly on foliage. For zinc deficiency, spray 0.5% zinc sulphate + 0.25% slaked lime prepared by mixing 1 Kg Zinc sulphate and 500 grams of slaked lime in 200 litres of water for an acre. Dissolve zinc sulphate separately, mix in the spray tank, and add slaked lime solution last to avoid leaf burn. Another cause is root disease or nematode attack, which causes root rot, damping-off, or nematode damage to roots, limiting nutrient uptake. It can be managed by root zone drench with Copper oxychloride 3 g\/L water, which is 600 grams in 200 litres of water. The pre-harvest interval of 15 days is needed in cotton to protect workers during subsequent field operations. Some methods to control Nematodes are Cultural Practices, such as Crop rotation with non-host crops (wheat, barley, maize, bajra) for 2\u20133 years to reduce nematode populations, and growing of Trap crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.) as a trap crop around cotton fields to suppress root-knot nematodes.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What should be done to attain softness of land?","Final Answer":"Softness refers to loosened soil structure for better root penetration. Improved moisture retention and aeration, reduced compaction, especially in intensively farmed areas. Best Practices to Improve Soil Softness: Add Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 8\u201310 tonnes\/acre before sowing. Incorporate green manure crops (e.g., dhaincha, sunhemp) before rice or wheat, add humus and improve soil texture. Incorporate paddy straw instead of burning\u2014PAU promotes happy seeder or mulcher use. Over-tillage can break down soil aggregates and lead to a hard crust after drying. Use minimum tillage or zero tillage for wheat after paddy to preserve structure. A hardpan forms 6-9 inches deep due to repeated puddling for rice. Use a sub-soiler or chisel plow every 3\u20134 years to break this layer and improve root growth and water infiltration. Follow soil test-based fertilizer application: excess nitrogen without enough potash and micronutrients can worsen compaction. Apply gypsum at 2 to 6 tonnes\/acre in sodic or hard clay soils to improve crumb structure. Use laser land leveling for uniform water application and crop rotation. Include legumes (moong, mash, berseem) in rotation-their root systems improve aeration and leave organic residues."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the application of Ratna powder?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a Kharif crop, not a Zaid\/Jayad crop. \u201cRatna Powder\u201d is usually a trade name for zinc sulfate (often ZnSO\u2084\u00b77H\u2082O, 21% Zn) or a similar micronutrient mix. In paddy, PAU does recommend zinc sulfate applications to prevent khaira disease and improve growth. Ratna powder contains zinc sulfate, which helps:Correct intervenal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) Improve root development. Enhance enzyme activity and protein synthesis. Soil application: Zinc sulfate heptahydrate at 10 kg\/acre mixed with 50 kg sand at puddling.

Spray during cooler hours (morning or evening) to avoid leaf burn. Ensure uniform coverage of leaves, especially the younger ones. Do not mix Ratna powder with phosphatic fertilizers or alkaline pesticides. Avoid spraying during high temperatures or rainy conditions."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Reddening of leaves?","Final Answer":"The reddening of leaves in paddy could be due to various factors such as nutrient deficiencies, disease infestations, or environmental stress. Reddening in leaves is mainly due to nutrient deficiencies. Most often due to potash (K) deficiency in soil, especially in sandy or light-textured fields. Can also be linked to iron deficiency in alkaline soils, but iron usually shows yellowing rather than reddening. Sometimes it appears due to water stress or an imbalance in N:P:K application. Phosphorus deficiency can also cause reddish or purplish leaves, especially in young plants under cool conditions. Potash deficiency is still the most common cause in standing crops. Symptoms include leaf blades showing reddish or purplish discolouration, starting from the tips or margins. In severe deficiency, leaves dry from the tips downward. Growth becomes stunted, and tillering is reduced. To prevent this nutrient deficiency, regular soil testing & monitoring of pH and nutrient levels are necessary to adjust fertilizer applications accordingly. Apply MOP @ 25 kg\/acre as basal or early topdressing, apply SSP\/DAP as per soil test, and avoid late planting in cool seasons and apply MOP @ 15-20 kg\/acre if deficiency is observed during the active tillering stage. Apply Foliar 1% K\u2082SO\u2084 10 g\/l and avoid excess nitrogen without potash."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the reasons for the reddening of leaves?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the kharif season because it requires plenty of water and warm temperatures, which are available during the monsoon. The zaid season is too hot and dry with insufficient rainfall, making it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. Paddy leaves usually start turning red when the crop faces stress, most often due to nutrient deficiency, particularly phosphorus, or cold weather conditions during early growth. Low phosphorus in the soil slows plant metabolism, leading to reddish or purplish leaves. This problem can also occur if the soil is too acidic\/alkaline, roots are damaged, or waterlogged conditions limit nutrient uptake. To avoid this, ensure timely application of phosphorus fertilizers like Single Super Phosphate (SSP) or DAP at recommended doses (27 kg DAP or 75 kg SSP per acre before puddling) during field preparation or early tillering, maintain proper drainage, and keep the crop free from prolonged standing water or root injury. This will help the leaves regain their healthy green color and improve plant growth."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why gypsum is added in cotton field and what is the recommended dose per acre?","Final Answer":"Cotton is grown in the Kharif season and not in the Zaid season because cotton needs a long, hot, and sunny growing period of 160\u2013180 days, which matches the Kharif climate but not the short Zaid window. Gypsum is added to the cotton fields mainly to improve their structure and reduce problems caused by waterlogging and harmful salts. It works by breaking down heavy, compact soils, making them more porous so that excess water can drain away faster and plant roots can receive enough air to breathe. Gypsum also supplies calcium, which helps replace sodium in alkaline or saline soils, lowering the harmful effects of salts on crops. This is especially useful in waterlogged fields, where poor drainage and salt buildup can stunt plant growth. For sodic soils, applying gypsum at the rate of 1-2 tonnes per acre at the time of field preparation, depending on soil condition, can be very effective, but it is best to decide the exact dose through soil testing, which can be done at Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), State Agriculture Department Soil and Water Testing Laboratories, or Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Regional Research Stations. For best results, spread gypsum evenly and mix it well into the topsoil by ploughing before the monsoon or irrigation. This helps the soil stay loose, improves water infiltration, and supports healthy crop growth, leading to better yields."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How should I use Copper Oxychloride (COC)?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the kharif season because it requires plenty of water and warm temperatures, which are available during the monsoon. The zaid season is too hot and dry with insufficient rainfall, making it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. In paddy, Copper Oxychloride (COC) is a widely used fungicide to control bacterial and fungal leaf diseases like bacterial leaf blight, sheath rot, and leaf spots. For best results, dissolve 2-3 gm per liter of water or 300-600 gm COC 50% WP per acre in about 200 liters of water and spray evenly, covering both sides of the leaves. COC can also be sprayed in combination with an antibiotic like Streptocycline (COC at 500 g\/acre + Streptocycline at 6 g\/acre in 200 liters of water), which enhances its effectiveness against bacterial diseases. Spraying should be done at the first appearance of disease symptoms and repeated at 10\u201312 day intervals if the disease persists. Always spray during cooler parts of the day (morning or evening) to avoid leaf burn and ensure better absorption. Also, avoid mixing COC with strongly acidic or alkaline pesticides, as this may reduce its effectiveness. This timely protection helps keep leaves healthy, allowing the crop to photosynthesize well and give a better yield. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) for Copper Oxychloride (COC) 50% WP in paddy is 14 days. This means that you should not harvest the rice crop for 14 days after applying the fungicide. This ensures that the residue levels on the grains and straw are within safe limits."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of Ulala?","Final Answer":"Ulala (Flonicamid 50% WG) is a systemic insecticide effective against sucking pests in cotton, such as aphids, jassids, thrips, and whiteflies. Recommended dose is 60-80 grams per acre. This is always accompanied by 200 litres of water per acre. Ulala is rainfast within 2 hours after application, ensuring efficacy even after light rain. It is crucial to be aware of the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) when using Ulala (Flonicamid 50% WG) insecticide on cotton. Pre-harvest interval for Flonicamid on cotton is 25 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control leaf caterpillar in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Leaf caterpillars are common pests in wheat, causing damage to leaves and affecting the crop's health and potential yield. They are the larval stage of various moth species that feed on leaves, creating holes and lesions. Severe infestations can lead to defoliation, reduced photosynthesis, weakened plants, and potential yield loss. Rotating wheat with non-host crops can disrupt the leaf caterpillar's life cycle. Weeds can act as alternate hosts, so maintaining a weed-free environment is beneficial. Spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC at 30 ml per acre in 100 litres of water per acre. Ensure proper and thorough spray coverage of the foliage for maximum effectiveness, particularly targeting the undersides of leaves. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) is 14 days, so harvesting should be done only after 14 days of spraying."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the ideal time to spray in Cotton?","Final Answer":"The best time to spray cotton depends on the crop stage and pest presence. During August, farmers should closely monitor for jassids (leafhoppers); if there are more than 5 per leaf, an immediate spray with neem-based or recommended insecticides like Imidacloprid or Acetamiprid is advised. For pink bollworm, pheromone traps at 5\/acre for monitoring. If the pink bollworm is above ETL, spray Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 80 g\/acre. Foliar nutrient sprays such as potash (13:0:45) or DAP are best applied around 85, 95, and 105 days after sowing to boost flowering and boll formation. Fungicide sprays with Tebuconazole should be done at 60, 90, and 120 days if leaf spots or diseases appear. Always spray early in the morning or late evening for best results, and avoid spraying during hot parts of the day."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is APSA-80?","Final Answer":"Paddy (rice) is not typically grown during the Zaid season. APSA-80 is not recommended by PAU (Punjab Agricultural University) in its Package of Practices (POP), as it is a private product by Amway and not officially tested or endorsed by PAU. Farmers are advised to use only PAU-approved surfactants or spreaders that have been evaluated for effectiveness and safety under local agro-climatic conditions. Amway\u2019s APSA-80 is an adjuvant spray widely used by farmers to enhance pesticide efficiency and improve irrigation effectiveness. APSA-80 works by reducing the surface tension of water, enabling spray solutions to spread more evenly and penetrate better into paddy plants, which improves control of insects, diseases, and weeds. It also promotes faster water infiltration into compacted soils, reducing runoff and conserving water. Additionally, APSA-80 helps keep pesticides properly mixed in the sprayer, preventing separation and ensuring uniform application. The recommended dose for foliar sprays (insecticides or fungicides) is 5 ml per 15 liters of water, amounting to about 60-80 ml per acre based on a 200-liter spray volume. For use with irrigation water, the dose is higher, around 160-200 ml per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control whitefly in Cotton?","Final Answer":"Whitefly, also known as \"White Tela\" in some regions, is a significant pest of cotton, causing damage by sucking sap, transmitting viruses, and promoting sooty mould growth. Infestations can lead to chlorotic spots on leaves, premature defoliation, poor boll opening, and shedding of buds and bolls. Whiteflies also act as vectors for Cotton Leaf Curl Virus. Rotate cotton with non-host crops like sorghum or maize to disrupt the whitefly life cycle and reduce the build-up of whitefly populations. Remove and destroy alternate weed hosts from the field and surrounding areas. For an acre of cotton, it is generally recommended to use 4-6 yellow sticky traps. Apply Imidacloprid 17.8% SL 40 ml\/acre or Buprofezin 25% SC 405 ml\/acre in 200L water. The pre-harvest interval of Buprofezin is 20 days, and Imidacloprid is 40 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is Ferterra?","Final Answer":"No, Paddy (Rice) is not typically grown during the Zaid season. While paddy is a major Kharif crop, it's not usually cultivated during the Zaid season (March-June). Fertara (also known as Ferterra) is an insecticide used in paddy (rice) cultivation. Targeted pests are the yellow stem borer and paddy leaf folder. It provides long-lasting control of key rice pests like stem borers and leaf folders. Controlling pests helps ensure healthier plants and potentially higher yields. It is relatively safe for non-target arthropods, including beneficial insects like natural parasitoids and predators. The recommended dose of Ferterra for yellow stem borer and paddy leaf folder control in rice is 4 kg per acre. The tillering stage is considered an effective time to apply Ferterra to reduce infestations."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control leaf folder in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Leaf folders are significant pests, particularly in paddy crops, and can cause considerable yield losses if not managed effectively. Choose leaf folder-resistant rice varieties. The larva folds the leaves longitudinally, and the larva remains inside. The larva scrapes the green tissues of the leaves, which later become white and dry. During severe infestation, the whole field exhibits a scorched appearance. Avoid overusing nitrogen fertilizer, as it can worsen the infestation. Keep your fields and nearby areas free of weeds and other host plants. Apply Ferterra (Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 GR) at 4 kg\/acre or Cartap hydrochloride 4G at 10 kg\/acre at 30-35 DAS (tillering) or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC at 60 ml\/acre in 200 L water. Importantly, always observe the mandatory Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI)-usually about 14 days for these chemicals- to ensure crop safety and avoid harmful residues at harvest."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of magister in Cotton?","Final Answer":"Magister's active ingredient is Fenazaquin 10% EC. It is primarily an acaricide (miticide), effective against various mite species, including red spider mite and two-spotted spider mites. It is typically applied as a foliar spray. The recommended dose of Magister (Fenazaquin 10% EC) insecticide for controlling mites in cotton is 400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water. Ensure proper coverage of the cotton foliage, particularly the underside of the leaves, during spraying for effective control. Rotate Magister with insecticides from different chemical groups to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in mite populations. Most importantly, always observe the mandatory Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 14 days after spraying to ensure crop safety and protect farm workers during subsequent field operations."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the harmful effects of 2,4-D in Cotton?","Final Answer":"Cotton farming faces a challenge known as 2,4-D injury, which occurs when the cotton crop is exposed to the herbicide 2,4-D. Cotton plants are highly sensitive to 2,4-D, a herbicide commonly used to control broadleaf weeds. Even small amounts of 2,4-D can damage cotton if it drifts or moves from nearby areas where it's applied. 2,4-D injury can cause cotton leaves to become distorted, cupped, or strap-shaped, and can delay plant maturity and potentially impact yield. Instead, immediately give a light irrigation to help dilute residual herbicides in the soil. Follow this with foliar sprays of a nutrient tonic containing 1\u20132% urea and zinc sulphate to promote new healthy growth and aid recovery. Preventive measures to avoid herbicide drift are essential for future crops."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the harmful effects of excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in Cotton?","Final Answer":"Using too many pesticides and fertilisers in cotton fields has serious drawbacks. Insects and weeds adapt, making chemicals less effective. Killing primary pests can lead to new pest problems. High chemical doses can stunt growth and affect cotton quality. Despite the intention of boosting yields, overuse of chemicals can actually harm cotton plants, leading to reduced growth, poor boll formation, and overall lower yields. Excessive or imbalanced application of fertilisers can disrupt the soil's natural nutrient balance, leading to nutrient deficiencies or toxicities in the plants. Overdosing on certain chemicals can negatively impact the quality of the cotton fibre, potentially reducing its market value."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of ethion in cotton?","Final Answer":"Ethion is an effective insecticide used to control pests like jassids, whiteflies, and bollworms in cotton. For best results, mix 2 ml of Ethion 50 EC per litre of water or 600-800 ml per acre and spray it evenly on the crop, ensuring thorough coverage of the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves where pests usually reside. Apply the spray when pest populations reach the economic threshold level, for example, when there are more than two jassids per leaf or a significant whitefly infestation. It is recommended to spray in the early morning or late evening to protect beneficial insects and reduce evaporation. Always follow the pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 15 days before picking cotton, so that residues on bolls remain within safe limits."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why cotton boll not opeing correctly and how can I fix this?","Final Answer":"The problem of poor boll opening in cotton is generally caused by a combination of physiological stress, pest attacks, unfavourable environmental factors, and certain diseases. Physiological stresses such as subsoil salinity, light sandy soils, nitrogen deficiency, prolonged low humidity combined with warm and dry weather, and inadequate soil moisture during boll formation can hamper proper boll maturation. Adverse conditions like drought or irregular irrigation, nutritional imbalances, and poor soil health also contribute to the problem. Pest damage, particularly from pink bollworm, can directly affect boll development, while boll rot diseases lead to premature decay inside the bolls, preventing them from opening. To manage this problem, it is essential to ensure timely and consistent irrigation during flowering and boll formation stages. Crop residues should be removed and infested bolls destroyed to reduce pest and disease pressure. Avoid early sowing to reduce pest buildup. For pest control, particularly bollworms, timely sowing before May 15 is recommended, along with crop residue destruction after harvest. Insecticide sprays such as Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre in 150\u2013200 litres of water, or Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @@ 80-100 grams per acre in 200\u2013250 litres of water, should be applied as needed. Boll rot diseases also cause premature boll decay and prevent proper boll opening, to manage this proper field sanitation, avoid excessive irrigation especially during boll maturation, maintain balanced nutrient management to strengthen plant resilience against pathogens, and apply fungicides such as Propineb 70% WP @ 600 grams in 200 litres of water or Mancozeb 75% WP at 600 grams in 200 litres of water. For cotton, the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) is about 7\u201310 days for Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC, around 7-14 days for Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG, approximately 7 days for Propineb 70% WP, and  7\u201314 days for Mancozeb 75% WP."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the side effects of Affinity and Topik in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Affinity (Carfentrazone) is a weed-killing chemical used in wheat fields, but it can sometimes harm wheat plants if not used carefully. If sprayed at the wrong time or mixed with other strong chemicals, it may cause small brown or dead spots on the leaves, called \u201cnecrotic spots.\u201d This may look like slight leaf damage, but it usually does not stop the wheat from growing properly or reduce the harvest if used correctly. To avoid harming the plants, follow the instructions carefully: don\u2019t spray too early, don\u2019t mix it with strong additives, and spray only under good weather conditions. While Topik (Clodinafop) is effective in controlling grassy weeds in wheat, improper use can cause side effects such as leaf yellowing or browning, stunted growth, and reduced yield (phytotoxicity). To minimize these side effects, always follow the recommended dose, apply at the proper growth stage, and avoid mixing with strong chemicals unless directed. Topik at 160 g\/acre is safe in wheat if applied at 30\u201335 DAS."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of gypsum in paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop, not a typical rabi season crop. Gypsum is recommended in paddy primarily to correct soil sodicity and improve soil structure, especially in alkaline or saline-affected fields. Use agricultural-grade gypsum (CaSO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O). Incorporate into the soil during final puddling. Follow up with good-quality irrigation to leach excess salts, and avoid use in already neutral or acidic soils. Soil amendment (sodic soils) 200-250 kg per acre. Before transplanting, during land preparation, sulfur supplementation-35 kg per acre of gypsum along with basal fertilizers, sulfur deficiency is confirmed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the harmful effects of small stones in soil and how can I manage this?","Final Answer":"In many of the fields, there are small stones mixed in the soil; these stones disturb plowing, stop seedling growth, make roots weak, and even damage our tractors or implements. So, first, after plowing, we should manually collect visible stones before sowing; for bigger fields, PAU recommends stone rakes and stone pickers, which save time and labor. Along with that, laser land leveling is very helpful; it gives an even soil surface, exposes hidden stones, and also improves yield and saves irrigation water. You can add farmyard manure or compost regularly, which makes the soil softer and the roots grow better even in stony patches. If in some corners stones always come back, then PAU suggests crop diversification like planting maize, fodder crops, or even fruit trees, which adjust better. Another tip is that seed treatment depends on the crops; it helps germination in hard soils. Before sowing, always do a soil test through KVK or a university lab so that nutrients are managed properly. Best practice is to remove stones every season, especially after rains, because new stones surface up, and to rotate crops with different roots to keep soil healthy. For machines, demo or expert help, just contact PAU Regional Research Stations or KVKs; their teams come to the field and guide. By following these simple steps, like manual and machine removal, proper leveling, organic matter addition, no wasteful chemicals, and the right crop choice, you can keep fields clean, protect your implements, and get better yields with less tension."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the application of Azotobacter?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop, not a typical zaid season crop. Azotobacter is used in paddy cultivation primarily as a biofertilizer to enhance nitrogen availability and improve soil health. Benefits\u2014Fixes atmospheric nitrogen in the rhizosphere, enhances root growth and seedling vigor, improves nutrient uptake and yield, and reduces dependence on chemical nitrogen fertilizer. Apply Seedling Root Dip\u2014500 g to 1 kg per acre of Azotobacter culture in 10\u201315 liters of water before transplanting. Soil application 2-4 kg per acre Azotobacter mixed with 50 kg FYM or compost at transplanting or during puddling, use a foliar spray (less common 1-2 kg per acre in 100 liters of water at 30-40 days after transplanting)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to correct sulphur deficiency?","Final Answer":"In a wheat field, if you see young leaves turning pale yellow while the old leaves stay green, the plants look stunted, and sometimes stems turn reddish, that is a clear sign of sulfur deficiency. To fix it, follow this PAU-approved step-by-step approach so your crop gets full benefit without wasting money. First, get your soil and plant samples tested in an authorized lab. This confirms if sulfur is really low and tells you how much to apply. Don\u2019t grow wheat on the same field every year if your soil is low in sulfur. Rotate with pulses or other crops that can pull up more sulfur from deeper layers. Add well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) at 10 tons per acre every season to naturally improve sulfur availability and keep the soil healthy. For natural or biological control, mix Trichoderma viride @ 2 kg per acre in moist compost and broadcast before sowing or after land preparation. These friendly microbes help unlock nutrients, including sulfur, over time. For chemical control, you can apply gypsum (calcium sulfate) @ 100 kg per acre. While 100 kg per acre is a good general recommendation for correcting sulfur deficiency in wheat, sandy soils like sandy loam or loamy sand with low organic matter require doses close to 100 kg, whereas medium- to heavy-textured soils, such as silty loam, clay loam, or loam with better sulfur retention, can effectively use lower doses around 35 kg per acre, depending on soil testing and deficiency severity. Mix well into the top 4\u20136 inches of soil and irrigate. Gypsum not only provides sulfur but also adds calcium, improving soil structure. If deficiency appears during crop growth, spray ammonium sulfate @ 2\u20134 kg per acre in 200 liters of water at critical stages like tillering and jointing. This directly feeds sulfur to the plant when it needs it most. Spray early in the morning or evening to avoid leaf burn. You can also use sulfur-coated urea @ 8\u201312 kg per acre, which supplies both nitrogen and sulfur slowly and efficiently. Neem-coated urea (NCU) @ 110\u2013120 kg per acre can be applied as a split dose at the growth stage. Since NCU only increases nitrogen, combine it with gypsum or ammonium sulfate if your soil is low in sulfur. By combining soil testing, crop rotation, organic matter, beneficial microbes, gypsum application, quick foliar sprays, and modern sulfur-coated fertilizers, you can keep your wheat healthy, grains well-filled, and achieve high yields."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended seed rate of Rice varieties?","Final Answer":"Rice is not suitable for Jayad season, rice is cultivated in the kharif season (June-July), where you should choose popular and better varieties like PR 126, a popular rice variety that requires 8-10 kg of seed\/acre for direct seeding or 4-5 kg for transplanting methods. This variety yields 30-32 q\/acre and matures in 123-125 days. Its key advantage includes resistance to bacterial leaf blight and suitability for late sowing conditions. PR 121 offers early maturation for water-saving cultivation. The seed rate is 7-9 kg\/acre for direct seeding or 4 kg for transplanted crops. Farmers can expect yields of 28-30 q\/acre from this variety. Its short duration of 111-115 days helps save about 30% irrigation water compared to longer duration varieties. PR 124 stands out for its high-yielding potential among non-basmati varieties. It requires 8-10 kg of seed\/acre across all planting methods. The variety produces 32-34 q\/acre and takes 128-130 days to mature. Its strong stems provide good lodging resistance during storms. Pusa Basmati 1509 represents the premium aromatic rice category. It needs only 4-5 kg of seed\/acre but must be transplanted. The yield ranges between 18 and 20 q\/acre due to its superior grain quality. This variety matures in 115-120 days and commands higher market prices. Pusa Basmati 1692 offers improved basmati characteristics. With a low seed rate of 4 kg\/acre, it yields 20-22 q\/acre. The 125-day duration variety produces extra-long, slender grains preferred in export markets. Its aroma and cooking quality make it valuable for speciality rice products. HKR 47 leads in yield potential among hybrid varieties. It requires 6-8 kg of seed\/acre for planting. Farmers can harvest 35-38 q\/acre from this high-performing hybrid. The longer duration of 135-140 days requires careful water and nutrient management. You should always use certified seeds from approved sources. Proper seed treatment before planting improves germination."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why tilt is used and what is the recommended dose?","Final Answer":"Tilt (Propiconazole 25% EC) is a fungicide used against yellow rust, brown rust, and leaf blight. The recommended dose is 0.5 ml\/litre of water. (100-120 ml of Tilt in 200 litres of water). A second spray may be needed after 15 days if the disease persists (avoid more than 2 sprays\/season). Tilt is banned for use after flowering to protect pollinators. Never mix Confidor and Tilt, as they are incompatible. Take advice from an agri expert, and when spraying, always use safety gear."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What to do when irrigation water quality is not good?","Final Answer":"The water quality is not good for paddy cultivation due to a severe groundwater crisis. The main problem is the over-extraction of water from deep underground, which has led to a drastic fall in the water table. This deep-well water is often contaminated with naturally occurring elements like uranium and arsenic, as well as pollutants from agricultural runoff like nitrates and pesticides. Farmers should adopt micro-irrigation systems like drip and sprinklers and use techniques like Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) for paddy, which saves a significant amount of water without reducing yield. Reviving the old canal irrigation network and promoting rainwater harvesting can help replenish groundwater and reduce the need for unsustainable pumping."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the application of Chloro","Final Answer":"Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide commonly used in paddy cultivation for controlling various insect pests, like stem borers, leaf folders, rice hispa, caseworms, armyworms, etc. It works as a contact and stomach poison, affecting the nervous system of insects.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding colour tag on foundation seed","Final Answer":"In agricultural seed certification, different classes of seeds are distinguished by specific colour tags. These tags provide crucial information about the seed's quality, genetic purity, and generation. Foundation seed in India is identified by a white colour tag as per official seed certification standards. It is the direct progeny of breeder seed and is produced under strict supervision to ensure high genetic purity and quality. The white tag on foundation seed includes essential details such as the crop name, variety, lot number, purity percentage, germination rate, and the certifying agency's seal. This seed is primarily used for producing certified seed, which is later distributed to farmers. Tag colour helps differentiate seed classes - while breeder seed carries a golden yellow tag and certified seed has a sky blue tag, foundation seed is always marked with white."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Ferterra","Final Answer":"No, paddy (rice) is not typically grown during the Zaid season. While paddy is a major Kharif crop, it's not usually cultivated during the Zaid season (March-June). Fertara (also known as Ferterra) is an insecticide used in paddy (rice) cultivation. Targeted pests are the yellow stem borer and paddy leaf folder. It provides long-lasting control of key rice pests like stem borers and leaf folders. Controlling pests helps ensure healthier plants and potentially higher yields. It is relatively safe for non-target arthropods, including beneficial insects like natural parasitoids and predators. The recommended dose of Ferterra for yellow stem borer and paddy leaf folder control in rice is 4 kg per acre broadcast uniformly in 2\u20133 cm standing water at 20\u201325 days after transplanting (active tillering stage). The tillering stage is considered an effective time to apply Ferterra to reduce infestations."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the ideal planting time of Paddy?","Final Answer":"The ideal planting time for paddy depends on the cultivation method. For the traditional transplanting method, nursery sowing is usually done from late May to early June, and the seedlings are transplanted into the main field between June 20 and July 10. For direct-seeded rice (DSR), the preferred window is the first fortnight of June, which helps conserve water and allows for early crop establishment. Timely planting is crucial for achieving good yields, reducing pest and disease risks, and making efficient use of irrigation resources. In the transplanted method, seedlings are placed with a spacing of 20 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants, using 2\u20133 healthy seedlings per hill. Proper field preparation, including puddling, helps with weed control and good root establishment."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are symptoms of neck blast in paddy and how can I control it?","Final Answer":"Neck blast is a destructive fungal disease affecting paddy, caused by the fungus Pyricularia oryzae. While it's the same fungus that causes leaf blast, it becomes particularly harmful when it attacks the \"neck\" of the panicle, the part of the plant that holds the grains. This infection effectively cuts off the flow of water and nutrients to the developing grains. The disease is most common during the panicle emergence stage, typically from late August to September in Punjab. It thrives in high humidity (above 90%), cool nights, and overcast conditions. Another contributing factor is the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer, which makes the plant more susceptible. The symptoms of neck blast are quite distinct. You'll notice a brownish to blackish lesion or ring on the neck of the panicle. This weakens the neck, often causing it to break, a condition known as \"rotten neck.\" If the infection occurs early, the grains will remain empty and turn whitish, creating what farmers call \"white ears.\" Later infections result in shrivelled and poor-quality grains. To control neck blast, an integrated approach is essential, combining preventive measures with timely chemical sprays. Cultural practices are crucial; farmers should use balanced fertilization, avoid excessive urea, and apply nitrogen in split doses. Choosing blast-resistant varieties and cleaning fields of infected crop stubble also helps. The most effective control is chemical, and timing is key. Fungicides should be applied preventively at the late booting stage or when the panicle is just emerging. A second spray may be needed if conditions remain favourable for the disease. Apply Isoprothiolane 40% EC at 300 ml per acre (PHI-60 days), or Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG at 80 grams per acre (PHI-21 days). All of these should be mixed with 200 liters of water per acre to ensure thorough coverage. Always spray in the morning or evening to avoid evaporation and get better results. Rotate fungicides to prevent the development of resistance. Use appropriate safety gear such as a mask, gloves, goggles, full-sleeve shirts, and boots."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control parawilt in cotton crop?","Final Answer":"Parawilt in cotton is a physiological disorder, and no pathogen is involved. It generally occurs after droughts when the crop is heavily irrigated or there is heavy rain. Plants show sudden drooping of leaves, which ultimately wilt, but the root system remains intact. The affected plants can be saved by spraying cobalt chloride at 10 mg per litre of water (10 ppm) immediately after the appearance of symptoms. There would be no recovery if permanent wilting has already set in."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding seed rate of PB-3","Final Answer":"Paddy (rice) is mainly grown in the Kharif season (June-October) and not in Rabi because rice needs a hot and humid climate with plenty of water for its growth. During Kharif in Punjab and other parts of India, the monsoon rains provide abundant water, and the temperature remains 25\u201335\u00b0C, which is ideal for rice germination, tillering, and grain filling. In contrast, during the Rabi season (November\u2013April), the climate is cool and dry with less rainfall and lower temperatures, which do not favour paddy growth. PB 3 (Punjab Basmati 3) is the first Basmati variety to show resistance to bacterial blight, a common rice disease. The seed rate of PB-3 paddy is around 8\u201310 kg per acre when using a nursery and transplanting method. If you plan to do direct seeding, then the seed requirement is slightly higher, about 12-15 kg per acre. The average yield is about 14-15 quintals\/acre, but since it is old and susceptible, PAU now recommends PB-1847, PB-7, PB-1718, etc. Instead of PB-3, use varieties like Pusa Basmati 1847 with an average yield of 19 quintals per acre, Punjab Basmati 7 with an average yield of 19 quintals per acre, Pusa Basmati 1718 with an average yield of 17 quintals per acre, Punjab Basmati 5 with an average yield of 15 quintals per acre, CSR 30 with an average yield of 13.5 quintals per acre, Pusa Basmati 1509 with an average yield of 15.7 quintals per acre, or Pusa Basmati 1121 with an average yield of 13.7 quintals per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding deficiency in wheat ","Final Answer":"Wheat crops often suffer from nutrient deficiencies, which can significantly reduce yield and quality. There are several types of deficiencies: Nitrogen deficiency: Characterised by yellowing of older leaves and stunted growth. To control this, apply urea at 50\u2013100 kg\/acre in split doses, with half at sowing and half at tillering. A foliar spray of 2% urea solution (20 g\/L of water) can also help. Phosphorus deficiency: Leads to purple or reddish leaves and poor root development. Use DAP at 50\u201375 kg\/acre as a basal application or SSP at 100\u2013115 kg\/acre. A foliar spray of 1\u20132% DAP solution (10\u201320 g\/L of water) can be used if needed. Potassium deficiency: Causes yellowing and browning of leaf edges and weak stems. Apply MOP at 25\u201350 kg\/acre or SOP at 30\u201360 kg\/acre. A foliar spray of 1% potassium sulfate (10 g\/L of water) can correct deficiencies quickly. Zinc deficiency: Results in interveinal chlorosis and white streaks on young leaves. Apply zinc sulfate at 10\u201320 kg\/acre every 2\u20133 years, or use a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulfate (5 g\/L of water) with lime to prevent leaf burn. Iron deficiency: Shows as yellowing between veins in young leaves. A foliar spray of 0.5\u20131% ferrous sulfate (5\u201310 g\/L of water) with citric acid improves absorption. Sulfur deficiency: Causes uniform yellowing of young leaves and reduces grain protein. Apply gypsum at 50\u2013100 kg\/acre or ammonium sulfate at 25\u201350 kg\/acre. Boron deficiency: Leads to poor grain setting and hollow stems. Use borax at 2\u20135 kg\/acre or a foliar spray of 0.2% borax (2 g\/L of water) at flowering. Magnesium deficiency: Causes yellowing between veins in older leaves. Apply a foliar spray of 1% magnesium sulfate (10 g\/L of water). For best results, conduct soil testing before applying fertilizers. A balanced NPK ratio of 120:60:40 kg per acre is recommended, adjusted based on soil test results. Organic options like FYM, compost, and vermicompost (5\u201310 tons\/acre) also improve soil health."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I improve quality of Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat is mainly a rabi season crop, where improving the quality of the wheat yield requires selecting high-quality wheat varieties as the first step to enhancing grain quality. Recommended varieties are HD-2967, PBW-725, WH-1105, and DBW-187, which offer good protein content (11-13%) and strong gluten properties. Disease-resistant varieties that can withstand yellow rust and Karnal bunt help maintain grain quality throughout the growing season. The proper sowing time has a significant impact on wheat quality. The ideal time for sowing is between November 1 and 20 to avoid heat stress during grain filling. Late sowing after November 25 often results in reduced grain weight and lower protein content in the harvested crop. Also, ensure balanced fertiliser application, like 120-150 kg N, 60-75 kg P\u2082O\u2085, and 40-50 kg K\u2082O per acre, should be applied in split applications. Micronutrients like zinc (5 kg ZnSO\u2084\/acre) and sulfur (20-25 kg\/acre) enhance protein content and milling quality. A foliar spray of 2% urea solution at the flowering stage boosts grain protein levels. Always maintain proper irrigation, and from time to time, visit the field for insect\/disease management."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide information regarding Pora method of sowing? ","Final Answer":"The pora method is a traditional wheat sowing technique, particularly for late-sown crops. This method involves broadcasting wheat seeds manually across a prepared field at a rate of 40\u201350 kg\/acre. After scattering the seeds, farmers perform light ploughing or harrowing to mix the seeds into the top 2\u20133 cm of soil. The key step involves dragging a wooden plank, called a pora, over the field to compact the soil and improve seed-to-soil contact. Immediate light irrigation follows to ensure proper germination. This method offers several advantages for certain farming situations. It requires minimal equipment, making it accessible to small farmers without seed drills. The process is faster than mechanical drilling, which helps when sowing is delayed after paddy harvest. Pora works particularly well in light-textured sandy-loam soils, where conventional drills may struggle. The soil compaction from planking helps retain moisture, which is beneficial in water-scarce conditions. However, the pora method has significant limitations compared to modern techniques. It uses substantially more seed (40\u201350 kg\/acre) compared to drill sowing (around 40 kg\/acre). Uneven seed distribution often leads to patchy crop stands and variable plant density. Fertilizer application is less precise, reducing nutrient use efficiency. Weed pressure tends to be higher due to shallow seed placement and uneven field conditions. The pora method works best under particular field conditions. Light-textured soils with good drainage are most suitable. The technique shows an advantage when time is limited after paddy harvest and drill equipment is not available. Small-scale farmers with limited resources may find it more practical to invest in seed drills. However, soil moisture at sowing time greatly affects success with this method."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Give information regarding nursery sowing method for paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Select a well-levelled and fertile area with loamy soil. Add 12\u201315 tons of farmyard manure or compost per acre and prepare the field by ploughing and removing weeds. Soak paddy seeds for 24 hours, drain the water, and keep them in wet gunny bags for 24-36 hours until sprouting begins. For raising a nursery for one acre, broadcast 8 kg of treated, pre-germinated seeds over 160 m\u00b2 (about 6.5 marlas) of prepared nursery bed. After sowing, cover lightly with a thin layer of farmyard manure to protect seeds from birds. Irrigate the nursery frequently to keep the soil moist. At sowing, apply about 1 kg urea and 2.4 kg SSP, and after 2 weeks of sowing, apply another 1 kg urea to promote healthy seedling growth. Seedlings are ready for transplanting after 25-30 days, when they are about 25 cm tall or have 6-7 leaves. For mechanical transplanting, a mat-type nursery can be prepared using a nursery seeder or by evenly spreading the seeds in beds with the help of a wooden frame. Water the nursery a day before uprooting to ease lifting without damaging the roots. If seedlings show yellowing of new leaves, spray 0.5-1% ferrous sulfate solution (500-1000 g in 100 L of water) at weekly intervals, three times. If leaves turn rusty brown after yellowing, spray 0.3% zinc sulfate solution (300 g in 100 L of water). Weeds such as swank and other annual grasses are the main problem in rice nurseries. To control them, apply 120 ml Butachlor 50 EC mixed with 20\u201330 kg sand evenly over the 160 m\u00b2 nursery area after sowing. For short-duration varieties, the recommended nursery sowing time is May 20\u2013June 7, and for Basmati, it is June 1 - June 20."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the Direct Seeded Rice method?","Final Answer":"DSR (Direct Seeded Rice) is a water-saving, labour-efficient alternative method of traditional puddled rice transplanting. In this method, paddy seeds are directly sown into the field with seed drills instead of nursery raising and manual transplanting, thus reducing dependency on standing water and heavy labour requirements, also reducing disease incidences(sheath blight, foot rot). Heavy and medium-texture soil is suitable for the DSR method. The soil should be ploughed with a disc harrow, followed by planking, and the field with a laser leveller. Sowing should be done from May 15 to May 31(new Punjab government guidelines, 2025), use 8-10 kg seed per acre for non-basmati and 7-8 kg per acre for basmati, and the recommended variety for DSR is short or medium-duration varieties such as PR-128, PR-129, PR-126, and Basmati 1718.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Give information about doses of cobalt chloride in cotton?","Final Answer":"Cobalt chloride is an inorganic chemical compound. In agriculture, it is used in very small quantities as a micronutrient supplement and as a plant growth regulator to improve stress tolerance. In cotton cultivation, cobalt chloride is not used as a primary fertilizer or a routine pesticide. Instead, it is used for a very specific purpose, primarily to treat parawilt, a condition where cotton plants suddenly droop after irrigation following a dry spell. It acts as an ethylene production inhibitor, counteracting the effects of ethylene, which is believed to be a contributing factor to parawilt. A plant growth regulator to help the plant cope with stress, particularly water stress (drought). Its main functions are improving drought tolerance: Cobalt helps plants regulate water loss by influencing the opening and closing of stomata (pores on the leaves). Reducing flower and boll drop: By mitigating water stress, it helps the plant retain its squares (flower buds) and bolls during dry spells, which is critical for protecting the final yield. Enhancing plant health: Cobalt is a component of vitamin B12, which is involved in nitrogen fixation and other essential plant processes, leading to better overall plant health. Cobalt chloride is applied as a foliar spray. The spray is most effective when applied at the start of the critical flowering and boll formation stage. This is typically when the crop is around 60-70 days old. Applying it at this time helps the plant manage any water stress that might occur during this peak reproductive phase. Using the correct dosage is extremely important, as excessive cobalt can be toxic to plants. The recommendations are for very low concentrations. The standard recommendation is a 10 ppm (parts per million) solution. To make this, you need to mix 10 milligrams of cobalt chloride in 1 litre of water. For one acre, you typically need 100 to 125 litres of water for a thorough foliar spray. Therefore, the total amount of cobalt chloride required per acre is 1.0 to 1.25 grams. Spray this solution evenly over one acre of your cotton crop, ensuring good coverage of the leaves."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control yellowing in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat, a vital Rabi (winter) crop, is typically sown between October and November and harvested from March to April. A common issue faced is the yellowing of wheat crops, a symptom of stress rather than a single disease. Accurately identifying the cause is essential for effective treatment. Carefully observe the pattern of yellowing in the field. If the leaves show distinct yellow stripes parallel to the veins and release a yellow-orange powder when touched, the crop is likely suffering from Yellow Rust (Pili Kungi). This is a fungal disease that requires immediate attention. If the yellowing is uniform across the leaves without any stripes, it is likely a nutrient deficiency. If the yellowing starts on the lower, older leaves and moves upwards, it indicates a Nitrogen Deficiency. Conversely, if it appears on the upper, newer leaves, it points to a Sulphur Deficiency. Yellowing can also occur in scattered patches throughout the field. This could be due to Zinc Deficiency, characterised by yellowing between the veins of the middle leaves, or it could be a sign of waterlogging in low-lying areas after heavy rain. Once the cause is identified, the correct treatment can be applied. For Yellow Rust, an immediate fungicide spray is critical. A recommended dosage is 200 ml of Propiconazole 25% EC or Tebuconazole 25% EC mixed in 200 litres of water per acre. The best long-term prevention is to sow rust-resistant varieties of wheat. Nitrogen Deficiency is corrected by applying Urea as a top dressing. As per PAU recommendations, farmers should apply 55 kg of Urea per acre with the first irrigation and another 55 kg with the second irrigation. For Sulphur Deficiency, using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at the time of sowing is the best preventive method. If the deficiency is observed later, a foliar spray of 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) mixed in 200 litres of water can help. Zinc Deficiency requires a specific spray solution: 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) and 500 grams of unslaked lime mixed in 200 litres of water per acre. The lime is vital to prevent the leaves from scorching. Finally, for waterlogging, there is no chemical solution; the only remedy is to drain the excess water from the field as quickly as possible to restore proper aeration to the plant roots."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control False smut in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"False smut in Paddy is a fungal disease that affects the panicle of rice plants. Individual grains are transformed into large, yellowish or greenish velvety balls. These smut balls eventually burst, releasing powdery spores, which can reduce grain quality and yield. False smut is typically found on rice during the flowering stage, and humidity during this period favours its growth. To control this, an integrated approach combining cultural and chemical methods is recommended. Avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertilizer, maintain proper plant spacing, and follow proper water management to reduce humidity. Apply Picoxystrobin 7.05% + Propiconazole 11.71% SC @ 400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 30 days) or Copper hydroxide 53.8% DF @ 500 grams per acre in 200 litres of water(PHI 21 days) at the panicle initiation or 50% flowering stage."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control more standing water in field area?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop. Growing paddy in Zaid (March\u2013June) is not recommended by PAU because Groundwater depletion is severe (already a big issue in the state). Standing water for long periods can cause root stress, iron toxicity, zinc deficiency, and fungal\/bacterial diseases. If you already have standing water, drain excess water immediately. Open field bunds at one corner and allow water to drain out. Maintain only a 2\u20133 cm water level (thin film) or just moist soil. Let the field water recede until hairline cracks appear, then irrigate again. This reduces standing water stress and saves irrigation. If leaves are turning yellow, spray 1% urea solution (1 kg urea in 100 L water\/acre). If bronzing\/yellowing persists, apply zinc sulphate heptahydrate @ 10 kg\/acre in standing water and mix well. Excess water + heat favors bacterial leaf blight & sheath blight. Keep water shallow and ensure good air circulation. Continuous water in the Zaid rice causes more harm than benefit."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Susari(Grain borer) in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a rabi season crop. Grain borer is a major pest of stored wheat, not typically found in standing crops, and can cause up to 40% damage in severe infestations. Infestations increase during the monsoon, when grains absorb moisture and soften. Storage practices to control grain borer: Sun-dry wheat grains thoroughly before storage (moisture <10%). Use airtight containers or polythene-lined gunny bags. Store grains in dry, ventilated godowns with cement flooring. Avoid mixing old and new grain stocks. Chemical control- Fumigation with aluminium phosphide tablets should only be carried out by trained government pest control operators or licensed professionals. Treat storage structures with Malathion 5% dust (do not apply directly to food grains). Other management practices: Use tamper-proof bait stations to protect non-target species, use eco-friendly hermetic storage bags (e.g., GrainPro), which reduce oxygen and kill pests naturally, inspect grains regularly for bored grains or powdery residues, use pheromone traps to monitor adult beetle activity, and conduct community-wide fumigation drives for synchronized control."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much fertilizer application is required of spraying NPK ?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop, recommended dose for paddy is: It is important to conduct a soil test before applying fertilizers, N:P: K = 50:12:12 kg per acre, Urea (N source): ~110 kg\/acre, SSP (phosphorus + sulfur): ~75 kg\/acre, MOP (potassium): ~20 kg\/acre. In case of nitrogen deficiency or poor uptake,  Foliar Nitrogen spray (2% solution) can be applied: 2 kg urea in 100 liters of water per acre, Spray during cooler hours (morning\/evening), Potassium spray - Potassium sulfate: 1-2 kg per 100 liters of water per acre, Phosphorus spray - mono potassium phosphate: 1 kg per 100 liters of water per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Nitrogen deficiency in Wheat crop? ","Final Answer":"Wheat is a rabi season crop. Symptoms of nitrogen deficiency: Nitrogen shortage typically shows up in older (lower) leaves as pale yellowing, eventually causing leaf drying and poor tillering. Nitrogen application: Apply half of the recommended urea dose (45 kg\/acre) at the time of sowing. Apply the remaining 45 kg\/acre at the first irrigation. For late-sown crops (after mid-December), reduce the total urea to approximately 35 kg\/acre, split between two applications. This improves nitrogen use efficiency and ensures a steady supply during early tillering. PAU Leaf Colour Chart (LCC) method: Farmers apply a starter dose of 46 kg N\/ha at the CRI (Crown Root Initiation) stage, then monitor leaf colour against the chart at key growth stages (~50\u201355 days after sowing). Additional N is applied only if the crop indicates it\u2019s needed. This method has saved 8\u201368 kg N\/ha without reducing yield. Green Seeker Optical Sensor method: A reference plot is maintained with a known higher N application. Sensor readings from both the crop and the reference plot are fed into the \u201cPAU-Urea Guide\u201d app, which calculates the optimal urea dose for the crop. Even if the second irrigation is delayed, readings and applications done around 50\u201355 days post-sowing save 15\u201320% nitrogen without yield loss while supporting healthy wheat growth."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much dose should I use of Deltamethrin in wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Deltamethrin 2.8 EC is used to control termites and other insect pests in wheat. The recommended dose is 400 ml per acre, which should be mixed in about 150\u2013200 litres of water and sprayed evenly on the crop. Always apply at the early stage of pest attack, avoid excessive use, and follow safety precautions while spraying. To protect the crop from termites, wheat seeds should be treated before sowing with a systemic insecticide such as Imidacloprid 48 FS at 5 ml\/kg seed or Thiamethoxam 30 FS at 10 ml\/kg seed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding NPK dose","Final Answer":"Apply nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085), and potassium (K\u2082O) based on soil test recommendations for rice and other crops. However, in the absence of a soil test, the general recommended NPK dose for most rice varieties is 42 kg nitrogen, 12 kg phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085), and 12 kg potassium (K\u2082O) per acre, which translates to about 90 kg urea, 27 kg DAP (or 75  kg single super phosphate), and 20 kg muriate of potash per acre. To obtain a higher yield of PR 132, apply 25% less nitrogenous fertilizers than other varieties. For the PR 132 variety, the recommended dose is slightly lower at 31.5 kg nitrogen, 12 kg phosphorus, and 12 kg potassium per acre (67.5 kg urea, 27 kg DAP, and 20 kg muriate of potash per acre). When 27 kg DAP is used in deficient soil, reduce the urea dose by 10 kg. All phosphorus and potassium fertilizers should be applied before puddling, while nitrogen should be split into three equal doses during crop growth. Using a soil test is always preferred for best results, and farmers are encouraged to use organic manures and bio-fertilizers where available, reducing chemical fertilizer doses accordingly."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the suitable time for Manganese application in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"You should apply Manganese (Mn) to your wheat crop as a foliar spray as soon as you notice the first symptoms of deficiency. This deficiency typically appears during the active tillering stage, often a few weeks after the first irrigation, when the crop is growing rapidly. Manganese deficiency is a common problem in sandy soils. It appears as greyish-brown to pinkish-brown specks or spots, primarily in the middle of the leaves. These spots later join together to form long streaks between the veins. The affected leaves often kink, bend, or droop from the middle. Manganese must be applied as a foliar spray because it is easily locked up in slightly alkaline soils when applied to the soil. Foliar spray preparation: Mix 1 kg of Manganese Sulphate with 500 grams (half a kilogram) of unslaked lime (calcium hydroxide) in 200 litres of water for one acre. Apply the first spray as soon as the symptoms appear. If symptoms persist, apply two to three more sprays at weekly intervals. For best results, always spray on a clear, sunny day to help the leaves absorb the nutrients more effectively."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control  waterlogging problem in paddy field?","Final Answer":"Waterlogging in paddy cultivation occurs when there is excessive accumulation of water in the field due to heavy rainfall, poor drainage, or over-irrigation. While rice requires standing water during its growth, prolonged waterlogging beyond the optimum level can harm the crop. It leads to oxygen deficiency in the root zone, which negatively affects root respiration, plant growth, and tillering. Excess water also increases the chances of diseases like sheath blight and root rot, and causes nutrient losses, especially nitrogen. To manage waterlogging, proper field levelling, bunding, and drainage channels are essential. Apply a foliar spray of 1% Urea solution (1 kg of Urea in 100 litres of water per acre) to provide readily available nitrogen to the stressed plants and promote quick recovery. On the other hand, Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) helps maintain soil moisture without continuous flooding. In low-lying or heavy soils, sowing on raised beds or ridges is beneficial. Also choose waterlogging-tolerant varieties like Swarna Sub1 or IR64 Sub1. Applying fertilizers, especially nitrogen, in split doses can reduce nutrient loss under waterlogged conditions. Overall, effective water management and good agronomic practices are key."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the use of cobalt chloride, and how much can I use?","Final Answer":"In paddy farming, spraying 1 gram of cobalt chloride dissolved in 100 litres of water is sometimes suggested to help with cobalt deficiency. Cobalt is a very small but important nutrient that can support the growth of helpful microbes around the roots. However, using cobalt chloride spray is not a standard or widely recommended practice for paddy crops. Usually, farmers should first check for common nutrient problems like nitrogen or zinc deficiencies, which have well-known and tested treatments. It is important to identify the exact problem before using any special sprays. Also, spraying should be done carefully in the cool hours of morning or evening and in the right amount to avoid harming the plants. Proper diagnosis and use of recommended fertilizers and sprays will help paddy plants grow healthy and give better harvests. Better that excess cobalt is toxic, so farmers should not use it without expert advice."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Green caterpillar in wheat crop?","Final Answer":"The \"green caterpillar\" that attacks wheat is almost always the Armyworm (Mythimna separata). Here is how you can identify and control it. The larvae are greenish-brown with light and dark stripes running along their body. In the early stages, the young caterpillars feed on the leaves, scraping the green matter and leaving behind white streaks. The older larvae are more destructive. They feed voraciously on the leaves at night and, in severe cases, they cut the earheads from the stalk, causing direct and heavy yield loss. The recommended threshold for spraying is when you find 2 or more larvae per meter of crop row. If the population has crossed the threshold level, a chemical spray is required. Spinosad 45% SC @ 60-70 ml per acre in 100 to 150 litres of water (PHI-7-14 days), or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre in 100 to 150 litres of water (PHI-30 days), or Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ 80 to 100 grams per acre in 100 to 150 litres of water (PHI-14 days). Spray the solution uniformly over one acre of the crop. The armyworm caterpillar is nocturnal, meaning it hides during the day and feeds at night. For the best results, always apply the insecticide spray in the evening hours. To ensure long-term effectiveness, do not use the same insecticide repeatedly. If a second spray is needed, choose an insecticide from a different chemical group than the one you used first.  Use appropriate safety gear such as a mask, gloves, goggles, full sleeve shirts, and boots."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the use of Roko (Thiophanate Methyl) insecticide?","Final Answer":"Roko Thiophanate Methyl, which contains Thiophanate Methyl 70 WP, is used to control fungal diseases in Paddy. However, the Punjab state government imposes restrictions on its store, distribution, sale, and use, and it is not recommended by PAU for use on paddy and basmati paddy. The reason behind the restriction is due to pesticide residue remaining on grains, which is harmful for human health, and farmers face export rejection of Basmati paddy, especially in Europe, the USA, and the UAE. You can alternatively use safer fungicides such as Propiconazole 25 EC @ 200 ml per acre in 150-200 litres of water or Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml per acre in 150-200 litres of water, which are effective against sheath blight and blast disease.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Control of Jhulsa rog (Blight disease)","Final Answer":"Cotton can be affected by Bacterial Leaf Blight (commonly called blight), which causes dark spots on leaves and bolls and can reduce your yield if not managed properly. To control this disease, first choose resistant cotton varieties and practice crop rotation by growing non-host crops like cereals to reduce the buildup of bacteria in the soil. Keep your field clean by removing and destroying infected plant debris after harvest. Maintain proper spacing of about 75 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which helps prevent disease spread.  It affects above-ground parts of the plant; symptoms start with small water-soaked lesions that enlarge into black, angular, dead lesions on both sides of the leaf. It also affects young bolls and causes small, water-soaked spots at the centre, leading to premature boll drop. To manage this, an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical and chemical methods is recommended. Grow resistance or tolerance Bt cotton varieties, use certified disease-free acid-delinted seeds, treat seeds with hot water before sowing (56\u00b0C for 10 minutes), remove and destroy infected plant debris, install drip irrigation to avoid leaf wetness and avoid excessive nitrogen application. For chemical control of bacterial blight, spray a combination of Copper Oxychloride 50 WP at 600-800 grams per acre mixed well in 200 - 250 litres of water as soon as you notice symptoms (PHI is 7days, but applied only under expert guidance as it has some restrictions).

PAU 1509 basmati also demonstrates some natural resistance to leaf folder attacks. In mechanical control of leaf folder can be done only before flowering by passing the 20-30 m long coir\/jute rope, forwards and then backwards, both ways while touching the crop canopy. While passing the rope, ensure that water is standing in the crop. In chemical control, you can use flubendiamide 20% WG, which is effective at 0.3 gm\/liter of water (60-80 gm\/acre) with a 30-day interval period. Also, you can use chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC, which works at 0.3 ml\/liter or 60-80 ml\/acre with a 47-day interval period. Stem borer-resistant options include HKR 47 hybrids. These varieties develop stronger stems that deter larval entry. In Mechanical control, you can do hand picking of borers, also, you can use Cartap hydrochloride 4% GR granules, which should be broadcast at 10-12 kg\/acre. Cyantraniliprole 10% OD liquid formulation uses 0.3-0.4 ml per liter or 80-100 ml\/acre with a 10-15 day interval period. Against armyworms, you can use emamectin benzoate 5% SG at 0.4 gm\/lit. The per-acre dose ranges from 80 to 100 g\/acre. Always take an agri expert's advice, and always wear safety gear."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of Confidor?","Final Answer":"Confidor (Imidacloprid 17.8% SL) is an insecticide used to control aphids, termites, and brown wheat mites in wheat crops. It provides systemic protection for 15\u201320 days after application. The recommended dose is 0.3\u20130.4 ml per liter of water (60\u201380 ml\/acre with 200\u2013250 liters of water). Maintain a pre-harvest interval of 30 days after the last spray. Spray when pest populations reach economic threshold levels of 5\u201310 aphids per tiller. Avoid mixing Confidor with alkaline pesticides, as it may reduce effectiveness. Always take advice from an agricultural expert and wear safety gear while spraying."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of Fertilizer for wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Whenever you apply any fertiliser, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test. This helps in avoiding deficiencies and prevents the unnecessary and costly overapplication of nutrients. The recommended fertiliser dose for irrigated conditions is generally 110 kg urea, 55 kg DAP, or 155 kg SSP, and 20\u201340 kg MOP per acre if the soil is potassium deficient. Apply the full dose of phosphorus and potassium at sowing as basal fertilisers. Split the nitrogen dose into two: half at sowing and half later at the time of irrigation, typically during the first and second irrigation. If your soil has high phosphorus content, you can reduce the DAP dose, and if wheat is sown after December, reduce the urea dose. In micronutrient-deficient soils, apply zinc sulfate at 10 kg per acre and borax at 2 kg per acre based on soil testing. In rainfed areas, the recommended doses of fertilisers are 70 kg urea, 100 kg SSP, and 20 kg MOP if the soil is potassium-deficient. Half the urea, along with the full SSP and MOP, should be applied during sowing, and the remaining urea should be applied after winter rain."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the use of Thiram?","Final Answer":"Thiram is a broad-spectrum protective fungicide used mainly as seed treatment in paddy to protect against seed-borne and early soil-borne fungal diseases such as seed rot, seedling blight, and damping off. For paddy seed treatment, use Thiram 75% WS @ 2-2.5 grams per kg of seed. Coat seeds thoroughly with thiram before sowing, mix with a little water for uniform coverage, and dry seeds in shade. As thiram is mainly used as a seed treatment in paddy before sowing, so PHI - Pre-Harvest Interval or waiting period before harvest is not required. However, if it is used as a foliar spray(less recommended in paddy), then a PHI or waiting period of 7-10 days is required in paddy."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control termite in wheat crop?","Final Answer":"In wheat, termites cut seedlings, feed on roots, cause yellowing and wilting, plants dry up in patches, and easily pull out. It damages the crop soon after sowing and near maturity, and thrives well in sandy soils and dry conditions. To control termites in wheat, an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended. Use only well-rotted manure before sowing, remove crop residues and weeds, ensure frequent irrigation to keep soil moist, and avoid late sowing. For one acre cultivation, treat the seed by diluting with Thiamethoxam 70 WS @ 40 grams or Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 160 ml in 1 litre of water and spray the same on 40 kg seed spread on a thin layer in pucca ground or polythene. In case of serious infestation, broadcast Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 7 kg per acre or Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 1.2 litres per acre mixed with 20 kg moist sand before the first irrigation. Chlorpyrifos is a restricted insecticide; use this under the guidance of an agricultural expert and PAU recommendations."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Aphids?","Final Answer":"Aphids in wheat suck sap from leaves and earheads, causing yellowing, stunted growth and shrivelled grains. Aphid population maximum during February -March under cool-cloudy climate, to reduce aphid damage, it is necessary to control them. To control aphid population in Wheat, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, mechanical and chemical methods is recommended. Avoid late sowing, closely inspect earheads from milky stage onwards as aphids cause most damage at this phase, avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertiliser, conserve ladybird beetles, lacewings and parasitic wasps, maintain consistent soil moisture, and spray PAU homemade neem extract 2 times @ 2 litres in 80-100 litres of water at a weekly interval. In case of severe aphid infestation, insecticide spray is recommended.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me information regarding the reclamation of alkaline solis?","Final Answer":"Alkaline soil, characterised by a high pH (more than 8.2), a high exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP greater than 15), and a hard, calcareous layer at a depth of 0.5\u20131 meter, can restrict root penetration and water movement in wheat fields. Therefore, reclamation is necessary if you want to grow wheat in such soils. First, conduct a soil test to determine gypsum requirements, level the field, and construct strong bunds to ensure uniform water distribution. Apply gypsum @ 200\u2013250 kg per acre based on soil test recommendations, flood the field with water, and keep it submerged for at least a week. Incorporate organic matter such as green manure or farmyard manure into the soil before sowing to improve soil structure, increase water retention, and enhance the reclamation effect of gypsum. It is also recommended to use good-quality irrigation water, and if groundwater is used, it should be tested for quality."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control iron deficiency in transplanting Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Iron deficiency in paddy fields is common due to intensive cropping, high soil pH, and low organic matter, especially in light-textured soils. When the iron deficiency symptoms first appear, new and young leaves show yellowing between veins, the whole leaf may turn pale yellow or white, and in severe cases, brownish or necrotic spots may appear on the leaves. To correct this, apply 2-3 foliar sprays of 1% ferrous sulphate solution(1 kg ferrous sulphate + 250 grams lime in 100 litres of water) at weekly intervals depending on severity. Soil application of ferrous sulphate is not effective and recommended because iron quickly becomes unavailable in high soil pH. Additionally, incorporating green manure crops like dhaincha before transplanting can improve soil organic matter and reduce the occurrence of iron deficiencies in soil. Besides these, prolonged flooding of the field can help to overcome iron deficiency."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Zinc deficiency in transplanted Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"The symptoms of zinc deficiency appear in paddy at 2-3 weeks after transplanting. The lower leaves become rusty brown near the base and ultimately dry up, and yellow or white spots appear on older leaves, while seedlings with zinc deficiency remain stunted and tillerless. To control this, apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate heptahydrate or 16 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate per acre to the soil at the time of last puddling before transplanting rice. In highly deteriorated soils, the symptoms of zinc deficiency sometimes appear in patches even after the application of the recommended dose of zinc sulphate. In that case, broadcast 10 kg of zinc sulphate heptahydrate or 6.5 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate per acre mixed with an equal quantity of dry soil on the affected patches. If deficiency symptoms appear during the crop growth stage, foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulphate solution(1 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate per acre mixed with 500 grams unslaked lime in 100 litres of water) at a weekly interval can help to correct the problem."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Jhanda rog (Bakanae disease) in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Controlling Bakanae disease (also known as \"Jhanda Rog\") in paddy is an integrated process, with a strong focus on prevention through seed and seedling treatment. The disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium fujikuroi, is first visible in the nursery and becomes more apparent in the main field. The key symptoms are: The most characteristic symptom is the unusual elongation of seedlings that become much taller than the healthy plants in the same field. Thin Stems and Pale Leaves: Infected plants are often thin, weak, and have pale green leaves. The base of the stem often develops adventitious (extra) roots just above the ground level. As the disease progresses, the base of the plant stem rots, leading to the death of the plant. To control this disease, do seed treatment with Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 2 g per kg of seeds. Or for a high level of protection, a root dip treatment is highly recommended before transplanting in Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP @ 2 gm per litre of water, Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 1 g per litre of water. Or you can use biocontrol agents such as Trichoderma viride or Trichoderma harzianum @ 4-5 grams per kg of seed for seed treatment. PAU and other research institutions emphasize that a seedling root dip (dipping the roots in a fungicide solution before transplanting) is more effective than just a seed treatment."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me information regarding the salt composition of Accord Plus?","Final Answer":"Accord Plus is a selective, systemic herbicide. It is formulated to target and kill specific weeds without harming the wheat crop when used as directed. Its effectiveness stems from a combination of two active ingredients, Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 7.77% + Metribuzin 13.6%. Accord Plus is used for the post-emergence control of problematic weeds in wheat, which compete with the crop for nutrients, water, and sunlight, thereby reducing yield. It is particularly effective against Grassy Weeds: Notably Gulli Danda or Canary Grass (Phalaris minor), a major weed in wheat cultivation. It also controls wild oats (Avena fatua). Broadleaf Weeds: It is effective against a variety of broadleaf weeds, such as Chenopodium album (Bathu), Melilotus spp. (Senji), and others. The recommended dosage of Accord Plus is 500 ml per acre. Accord Plus should be applied at the post-emergence stage of the weeds, typically 30 to 35 days after sowing the wheat crop. It is often recommended to apply it after the first irrigation when the weeds are actively growing and have 3-4 leaves. Wear appropriate protective gear, including gloves, masks, and full-sleeved clothing, while handling and spraying the herbicide. Ensure that there is adequate moisture in the soil at the time of application. This ensures that the weeds are actively growing and will readily absorb the herbicide, leading to better control."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I sell my organic food?","Final Answer":"For farmers, transitioning to organic wheat cultivation presents a promising opportunity for premium pricing and sustainable agriculture. You can find buyers for organic wheat through the following channels: Local APMCs with organic sections. Organic federations, such as India Organic or APEDA-certified groups. Farmer-Producer Organisations (FPOs) that deal in organic produce. Joining an FPO is one of the most effective ways to sell organic produce, as these organisations pool resources, enhance bargaining power, and often have established supply chains. Local organic food companies and processors, such as those producing organic atta, suji, and other wheat-based products. Researching and contacting their procurement departments is a proactive step. While their main facilities may be in larger cities like Ludhiana or Amritsar, they often have procurement networks in key wheat-growing districts like Muktsar. Online platforms like Jaivik Kheti, AgriBazaar, eNAM, or Farmer app groups. Organic fairs and exhibitions, which help connect with bulk buyers. The Punjab government, through agencies like the Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC), actively promotes organic farming. While dedicated organic mandis are still emerging, the state government periodically announces procurement plans. Stay informed through the Punjab Agriculture Department about such initiatives."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Ferrous deficiency?","Final Answer":"Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient for paddy (rice) as it plays a vital role in the synthesis of chlorophyll, the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis. When the plant cannot absorb enough iron, it leads to a condition called \"Iron Chlorosis.\" The symptoms of iron deficiency are very distinct and almost always appear on the youngest or newly emerged leaves first. The most classic symptom is the yellowing of the leaf tissue between the veins, while the veins themselves remain green. This gives the leaves a striped or netted appearance. In severe cases, the entire leaf, including the veins, will turn yellow and may eventually become paper-white. Affected plants will be stunted, with reduced height and fewer tillers (side shoots). The deficiency is often first observed in the paddy nursery, where seedlings will look pale yellow and weak. If not corrected, the seedlings may die. If you know your field has a history of iron deficiency, you can apply Ferrous Sulphate to the soil. Apply 10 kg of Ferrous Sulphate per acre. Mix the Ferrous Sulphate with sand or dry soil for even distribution and broadcast it in the field before transplanting or at the time of final puddling. Or you can give foliar Spray (Fastest Method for Standing Crop). Prepare a 0.5% solution of Ferrous Sulphate by dissolving 1 kg of Ferrous sulfate in 200 litres of water for one acre. Spray this solution evenly over the affected crop, ensuring good coverage of the young leaves. It's recommended to add a sticker-spreader to the solution to help it adhere to the leaves. To prevent leaf scorching, some experts advise adding a small amount of slaked lime (0.5 kg) to the solution. Repeat the spray 2-3 times at weekly intervals."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Zinc deficiency?","Final Answer":"Zinc deficiency is one of the most common and critical micronutrient disorders in Paddy (Rice), famously known as 'Khaira disease. The symptoms of zinc deficiency are quite distinct and usually appear on the younger leaves first. Small, scattered, reddish-brown spots (like rust) appear on the lower part of the younger leaves. These spots enlarge and merge, and the entire leaf takes on a bronze or dusty brown colour. Eventually, the affected leaves dry up and die. The plant's growth is severely restricted, leading to a stunted and unhealthy appearance. Tillering (the growth of side shoots) is significantly reduced. In the field, you'll notice uneven growth, with patches of stunted, unhealthy-looking plants. The crop's maturity is often delayed, leading to a longer duration in the field. Zinc deficiency isn't always because the soil lacks zinc, but often because the zinc is unavailable for the plant to absorb. To control zinc deficiency in paddy, you can use a preventive Measure (Soil Application): This is the best long-term solution for fields with a known history of zinc deficiency. Apply 10 kg of Zinc Sulphate (21%) per acre. Apply it at the time of the final puddling, just before transplanting the paddy. This ensures it's well-mixed in the root zone. Or give foliar spray, this is the fastest way to correct the deficiency in a standing crop showing symptoms. Prepare a 0.5% solution of Zinc Sulphate by dissolving 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate (21%) along with 500 grams of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide or unbujha chuna) in 200 litres of water. The lime is crucial to neutralize the solution's acidity and prevent scorching the leaves. Spray this solution evenly over the affected crop. Repeat the spray 2-3 times at 10 to 15-day intervals until the new leaves emerge green and healthy."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control bacterial blight of cotton?","Final Answer":"Bacterial blight in cotton, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. Malvacearum is a destructive disease in cotton-growing areas in this region. It affects the above-ground parts of the plant. Symptoms start with small water-soaked lesions that enlarge into black, angular,\ndead lesions on both sides of the leaf. It also affects young bolls and causes small, water-soaked spots at the centre, leading to premature boll drop. To manage this, an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended. Grow bacterial blight-resistant or tolerance Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) cotton varieties, use certified disease-free acid-delinted seeds, treat seeds with hot water before sowing (56\u00b0C for 10 minutes), remove and destroy infected plant debris, install drip irrigation to avoid leaf wetness, and avoid excessive nitrogen application. Apply Copper Oxychloride 50 WP @ 600-800 grams per acre in 200-250 litres of water at the early stage of infection at 10-15 day intervals if symptoms persist. The PHI period for copper oxychloride is 7 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which are the most suitable varieties for Direct Seeded Rice method?","Final Answer":"Some of the Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) Varieties are PR-series (PAU varieties): PR-126 is the most widely recommended short-duration variety, ideal for early planting. Delivers strong early vigor, quick growth, and improved weed competitiveness. The yield is 30 quintals\/acre. Among non-basmati types, PR-131 (matures in about 110-115 days, average yield 30-32 quintals\/acre) and PR-121 (matures in 110\u2013115 days, yield 32\u201334 quintals\/acre) are recommended due to their shorter duration, better lodging resistance, and tolerance to major diseases. For premium basmati production under DSR, Pusa Basmati 1509, which is early maturing in 115-120 days, yields around 18\u201320 quintals\/acre and is popular for its short duration and fine grain quality, while Pusa Basmati 1121 takes 140-145 days, yields about 16\u201318 quintals\/acre. It is highly valued for its extraordinary kernel length, aroma, and export demand."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Jhanda rog (Bakanae disease)?","Final Answer":"Bakanae, being a seed-borne disease, the primary effective strategy is seed treatment. Always avoid seeds from contaminated fields and buy seeds from certified and trusted sources only. For seed treatment, use Thiram 75% WP @ 2.5 g\/kg seed or  Trifloxystrobin 25% + Tebuconazole 50% WG @ 0.4 g\/kg of seed. Alternatively, treat seeds with hot water (54\u00b0C for 10 min) after pre-soaking in water for 8 hrs.. Seed Treatment should be done 24 hours before sowing to ensure maximum effectiveness."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the ideal spacing of cotton crop?","Final Answer":"Cotton is a Kharif crop, not a Rabi crop. It is sown from April to May to align with the monsoon season.  The recommended spacing for cotton varies with the type of variety grown. For Bt and American hybrids, Bt cotton is 67.5 cm between rows. The plant-to-plant distance is then adjusted based on soil type: 75 cm for heavy soils and 60 cm for medium soils. Desi cotton hybrids and American varieties are generally spaced at 60 cm between rows and 15\u201330 cm between plants. For Desi cotton varieties, row spacing ranges from 45\u201360 cm with 15\u201330 cm between plants. In some cases, particularly with certain hybrids under specific practices, a much wider spacing of 120 cm between rows and 60 cm between plants is followed to accommodate their vigorous growth. This variation in spacing ensures optimum plant population, better air circulation, and efficient resource use depending on the growth habit of the cotton type."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which spray is recommended for managing mealybug in Narma cotton?","Final Answer":"The common symptoms of a mealybug attack are white cottony masses on leaves, shoots with stunted growth, leaf curling, and yellowing. Sooty mold develops on honeydew excreted by the pest, reducing photosynthesis. Some of the cultural control methods are removing and destroying infested plant parts. Avoid excess nitrogen, which encourages mealybug proliferation. Some of the Chemical controls are practiced by spraying insecticides when infestation crosses the economic threshold, 10\u201315% plants infested or 5\u201310 mealy bugs per plant. Imidacloprid 17.8 SL 40-50 ml in 200 liters of water or Thiamethoxam 25 WG 40-50 g in 200 liters of water. The pre-harvest interval for Imidacloprid 17.8% SL is 40 days, and for Thiamethoxam 25% WG, it is 14 days. Due to the pest's waxy coating, it is essential to add a surfactant or sticker like Teepol (0.05%) or Agral (0.05%), which helps uniform spreading and sticking to the 200 L\/acre spray solution to ensure the insecticide adheres to and penetrates the waxy layer."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the best practices for nutrient management in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a crop that eats lots of nutrients, so if we want a good yield and fine grain, then we must manage fertilizer properly. First thing is, always get your soil tested from the PAU or KVK lab, that way you will know what exactly your land needs. Before transplanting, add about 6 tonnes of FYM per acre; this keeps the soil alive and fertile. If you rotate paddy with wheat or pulses, the land stays healthy, and pests also go down. Along with that, you can mix biofertilizers like Azospirillum or PSB with manure, which makes nutrients available easily to the plant. For chemical dose on medium soil, PAU says give 90 kg nitrogen (195 kg urea per acre), split in three parts \u2013 one third at the time of transplanting, one third at tillering after 20 days, and again one third at panicle stage around 45 days. Give 45 to 50 kg phosphorus (110 kg DAP or 280 - 310 kg SSP per acre) and 40 kg potash (65 kg MOP per acre) only if the soil test says low potash. If you are using DAP, remember it already gives some nitrogen, so cut urea accordingly. For foliar support, spray Potassium nitrate 1.5% (3 kg in 200 litres of water per acre) at the booting stage, which helps in grain filling. Always use neem-coated urea instead of normal urea; this saves nitrogen loss and saves money. Treat the seed with Carbendazim 2 grams per kg (applied only under expert guidance, as it has some restrictions) or for safety, you can use Trichoderma 5 g per kg or thiram 3 grams per kg of seeds to keep fungus away. Fertilizer should always go into moist soil, and then give irrigation for absorption. Don\u2019t flood the field when applying urea; otherwise, nutrients will wash away. PAU varieties like PR 126, PR 113, and PR 132 are best; PR 126 needs around 90 kg N\/acre, and PR 132 can manage with less, about 67.5 kg N\/acre. If you follow this balanced practice, you will easily get a 27-31 quintal per acre yield, the crop will stay healthy, and input costs will also be reduced."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended method and dose for applying NPK 0:0:50 in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"SOP (0:0:50) is applied to Paddy through drip or as a foliar spray. It improves Grain filling and grain weight, lodging resistance, and Disease resistance (like sheath blight, brown spot). The recommended dose through drip irrigation is 1.5 gm to 2.5 gm per liter of water(300-500 gm in 200 liters of water) for an acre. Another method of application is the Leafy spray method, in which 1-2 kg SOP per acre is mixed in about 200 liters of water, applied after flower emergence."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the proper way to apply Chloro 20 (1\u202flitre) mixed with 10\u202fkg of sand during irrigation?","Final Answer":"Chloro 20 (Chlorpyrifos 20% EC) is a banned pesticide for Ber, Citrus, and Tobacco for its high level of toxicity. It is widely used for termite, soil insect, and sometimes cutworm control. The method and dose of application matter a lot for effectiveness and safety. The proper way to apply Chloro 20 (Chlorpyrifos 20% EC) during irrigation is to take 1 litre of the formulation, mix it thoroughly with about 10-15 kg of clean sand or well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), and then apply this mixture directly into the irrigation channel so that it flows evenly with the water into the crop\u2019s root zone. This method ensures uniform distribution of the chemical in the soil and provides effective protection against soil insects such as termites and cutworms. Care should be taken to use protective clothing while handling, avoid contaminating fish ponds and drinking water, and observe the recommended pre-harvest interval of 30 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the activation of USSD scheme?","Final Answer":"To activate USSD-based services for wheat, farmers do not need to register for a special scheme. Instead, the services are part of a broader government initiative called the mKisan portal and its related USSD platform. The USSD service works on any mobile phone and does not require an internet connection. A farmer can dial a code like 491103# to access farmer-centric services. After dialling, a menu will appear on the phone screen with various options. The farmer can navigate through the menu by entering numbers to select a service. Farmers can access daily market prices for various commodities, including wheat. The system provides details on the stock position and prices of fertilisers at local dealers, which is crucial for wheat cultivation. Farmers can receive information on weather forecasts and advisories related to crop management and pest control. Information on various government schemes and their benefits is also available."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you proviode me information regarding Dhanya and NPK spray?","Final Answer":"Dhanya is a herbal spray derived from medicinal plants that boosts a plant's natural resistance to pests like sucking pests, controls diseases such as leaf curl, and helps increase overall crop yield. In contrast, NPK spray is a water-soluble fertilizer containing essential macronutrients-nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)\u2014that are absorbed directly by the leaves. While Dhanya acts as a preventive organic pesticide, NPK directly feeds the plant to support rapid, healthy growth, root development, flowering, and fruiting. The two can be used together to manage plant health, with Dhanya protecting the crop from threats and NPK providing the necessary nutrients for robust growth."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Brown Plant Hopper (BPH)?","Final Answer":"To control Brown Plant Hopper (BPH), you must use an integrated pest management approach. Avoid dense planting. Wider rows improve air circulation, making the field less favourable for BPH. Do not apply too much nitrogen fertilizer, as it can make plants more attractive to the hoppers. Create empty rows after every 8-10 rows to improve airflow and allow for easier monitoring and spraying. If the pest population reaches a critical level (5-10 hoppers per hill), chemical control is necessary.  Use effective and modern insecticides. Recommended options include Pymetrozine 50% WG (120 gm\/acre), Dinotefuran 20% SG (60-80 gm\/acre), or Thiamethoxam 25% WG (40-50 gm\/acre).  Direct the spray towards the bottom of the plant to be most effective."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended practices for paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"Paddy (rice) is the most significant kharif crop, forming a crucial part of the region's rice-wheat cropping system. The farming practices and government policies in place are specifically designed to support its cultivation. Nurseries for raising paddy seedlings are typically sown in May. Transplanting usually begins around mid to late June. This timing ensures that the crop receives sufficient water from the monsoon rains. Farmers cultivate both non-basmati and basmati rice varieties. The choice of variety depends on yield potential, market price, and farming practices. Non-Basmati Varieties: High-yielding varieties like PR 121, PR 126, PR 127, and PR 129 are popular due to their high yield and good quality. Basmati Varieties: Premium basmati varieties like Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa Basmati 1509, and Pusa Basmati 1718 are also widely grown for their high market value and export potential.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the causes and control measures of Root rot in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Root rot in paddy is a common fungal disease caused by soil-borne fungi like Fusarium and Pythium species, leading to decay of roots and poor nutrient uptake. Symptoms include yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and wilting, especially under waterlogged and poorly drained conditions. To manage root rot, seeds should be treated with fungicides such as carbendazim at 2 grams per kilogram of seed before sowing, but applied only under expert guidance, as it has some restrictions. Foliar sprays or soil drenching with carbendazim 1 gram per liter of water (200 gm\/ac in 200 liters of water) with a waiting period of 30 days. Proper field drainage, crop rotation, and removal of infected plants are important cultural practices."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the use of Plant Growth Regulators (PGR)?","Final Answer":"Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) are special chemicals that help plants grow, stop growing, or change how they grow. They work even in very small amounts. Some of these are made naturally by the plant and are called plant hormones. Others are made by people in factories and are called synthetic (man-made) growth regulators. These chemicals are made in one part of the plant and move to another part to do their work. There are different types of plant growth regulators. Auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins help plants grow faster. Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene slow down plant growth. Some other types help plants make flowers, like florigen. There are also substances like vitamins that help plants stay healthy. Farmers also use special man-made regulators like CCC and Phosphin-D to increase crop yield, help plants flower better, or keep plants fresh for a longer time. For example, NAA is used to control flower and boll drop in cotton, with the standard mixing instruction of 1 ml in 4.5 liters of water."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the information regarding fruiting stage?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop; the 'fruiting' stage in a paddy crop is more accurately referred to as the ripening phase or grain filling stage, which follows flowering. This phase is crucial for the development and maturation of the rice grains within the panicles. Growth stages-Reproductive Phase: This phase encompasses the panicle initiation, booting, heading (panicle exsertion), and flowering stages. Ripening Phase (Fruiting\/Grain Filling): This phase begins after flowering and continues through the milk, dough, and maturity stages. Grain Filling: During this time, carbohydrates and nutrients are transported from the leaves and stem to the developing grains, resulting in grain filling and an increase in grain weight. Milk Stage: The endosperm within the grains has a milky consistency. Dough Stage: The milky liquid thickens into a sticky white paste as the grains dry. Maturity: The grains become opaque and hard, and the leaves start yellowing. Roughly 90% of the grains reach a moisture level of 25-30% and turn golden brown, indicating maturity. Maintain proper irrigation during this phase, applying water two days after the ponded water has infiltrated into the soil to prevent the soil from cracking. However, avoid excessive leaching and keep the water level within 10 cm. Stop irrigation about a fortnight before maturity to allow for easier harvesting and the timely sowing of the following Rabi crop."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended NPK spray schedule for Paddy?","Final Answer":"Yes, you can spray NPK fertilizers on rice; it's a common practice to boost crop growth at critical stages. However, it's crucial to understand that a foliar (leaf) spray is a supplementary dose or a \"booster shot.\" It cannot replace the main dose of fertilizers (like urea, DAP, and MOP) that you apply to the soil, which provides the bulk of the crop's nutrition. For the vegetative or tillering stage (25-35 days after transplanting), a balanced grade like NPK 19-19-19 or NPK 20-20-20. To promote vigorous growth, increase the number of tillers, and correct any minor nutrient deficiencies early on. For Panicle Initiation or Booting Stage (50-60 Days After Transplanting), a grade high in Potassium, like NPK 13-0-45 (Potassium Nitrate). This is widely recommended by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). Another option is NPK 0-52-34 (Mono Potassium Phosphate). To support healthy panicle development, improve grain filling, increase grain weight and shine, and enhance the plant's resistance to pests and diseases. To apply NPK as a foliar spray, use 1 kg of the water-soluble NPK fertilizer per acre in 150 to 200 liters of clean water. Dissolve it completely in a small amount of water (5-10 liters) in a bucket, and add this concentrated solution to the main spray tank and fill it with the remaining water. Mix the solution in the tank thoroughly, and use a knapsack sprayer with a fine nozzle to ensure uniform coverage on the plant leaves. The best time to spray is in the morning or evening when the temperature is cool and there is no strong wind. This prevents the spray from evaporating quickly and avoids scorching the leaves."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Pink stem borer in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season (June-July) crop, in which the pink stem borer is a significant pest affecting paddy crops. This pest causes damage by creating 'dead hearts' during the vegetative stage and white ear heads during the reproductive stage. For controlling it, you should choose resistant varieties like PR 126, which demonstrates moderate resistance against stem borers, while PR 127 shows good tolerance to pink stem borer attacks. PAU 201, developed by Punjab Agricultural University, offers better borer resistance.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control grasshopper attack in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Grasshoppers can cause significant damage if not managed properly. Controlling grasshoppers (often called Tidda in Punjabi) requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach. First, you need to determine if the number of grasshoppers in your field is high enough to cause actual financial loss. This is called the Economic Threshold Level (ETL). You should only consider chemical control when the population reaches or exceeds 5-10 grasshoppers per sweep with a standard insect net, or an average of 2 grasshoppers per hill. The most important step is to trim the grass on and around the field bunds. Grasshoppers lay their eggs and multiply on these grassy bunds. Keeping them clean destroys their habitat and breeding grounds. In the early stages of infestation, you can run a rope across the crop to dislodge the grasshoppers, causing them to fall into the paddy water, where many will drown. If you have monitored your field and the grasshopper population is above the ETL, you can use a chemical spray such as Quinalphos 25% EC at 800 ml in 150-200 liters (PHI 7-15 days) or Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC at 200 ml in 150-200 liters (PHI 7-15 days). Spray in the morning or evening when the wind is calm and the temperature is cooler for best results and to avoid harming pollinators. Ensure uniform coverage of the spray over the entire crop. Grasshoppers often congregate on the field borders, so pay special attention to these areas. If a second spray is needed, use an insecticide with a different chemical composition to prevent resistance development."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Termite (demak)?","Final Answer":"Termites are a significant pest of wheat. They can cause severe damage from the sowing stage up to maturity by feeding on the roots and base of the stem, leading to reduced plant stand and a condition known as \u201cwhite ears.\u201d Termites can also damage sown seeds, resulting in poor germination and a reduced plant stand. Termites feed on the roots and lower parts of the stems of young plants. Affected plants show wilting and yellowing. In mature plants, the most characteristic symptom is the appearance of dry, white earheads that contain no grains. This occurs because termites feed on the base of the stalk, cutting off the nutrient supply to the ear. The white ears can be easily pulled out of the ground. A combination of preventive and chemical measures is the most effective way to manage termites in wheat: Cultural practices: Deeply plough the field during the summer months to expose termite colonies and queens to the sun and predatory birds, killing them and reducing the initial population. Use well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM). Fresh or improperly decomposed manure can attract termites. Keep the field adequately moist during the early stages, as termites prefer dry soil. Seed treatment: Imidacloprid 70% WS: 3\u20135 g\/kg of seed, Thiamethoxam 70% WS: 2\u20133 g\/kg of seed. Mix the required amount of powder with a small amount of water to make a slurry and coat the wheat seeds evenly before sowing. This protects the seedlings for the initial 30\u201345 days. Soil application \/ bio-pesticides: Fipronil 0.3% GR: 5\u201310 kg per acre (broadcast application). Metarhizium anisopliae: 2\u20134 kg per acre (powder) or 1\u20132 litres per acre (liquid). This bio-pesticide is a fungus that infects and kills termites upon contact. To prevent insecticide resistance, avoid using the same class of chemical repeatedly."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me information regarding the storage of Wheat?","Final Answer":"Proper storage of wheat after harvest is essential to prevent losses from insects and pests.

The \"25% WG\" indicates that it contains 25% of the active ingredient, thiamethoxam, in a water-dispersible granule form. This formulation allows for easy mixing with water and application as a spray. Thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid insecticide. It acts as a systemic insecticide, meaning it's absorbed by the plant and moves through its vascular system. This protects against pests that feed on the treated plant, both above and below ground. It also has contact and stomach poisoning activity. Thiamethoxam 25% WG is effective against a wide range of sucking and chewing insect pests. It's commonly used to control aphids, thrips, whiteflies, leafhoppers, and various other pests in crops like rice, cotton, vegetables, and more. It can also be used as a seed treatment to protect against soil-dwelling pests. Thiamethoxam WG is most commonly applied as a foliar spray. The recommended dosage for a foliar spray is 40-50 grams per acre in 200 liters of water. Spray it evenly over the crop, ensuring good coverage of the leaves. Thiamethoxam, like all neonicotinoids, is highly toxic to bees and other pollinators. To protect them, DO NOT spray it on any crop during its flowering stage. Always wear protective clothing, gloves, and a mask when handling and spraying the chemical. PHI may vary by crop (e.g., 21 days for paddy, 5 days for chili) and must be strictly followed."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding control of early maturity","Final Answer":"Maturing too early results in poor tillering, reduced grain yield, and uneven maturity. There are specific cultural, nutritional, and hormonal strategies that can help delay maturity and enhance grain filling. Causes of early maturity in paddy are due to transplanting old seedlings, nutrient deficiencies (especially insufficient nitrogen), abiotic stresses (e.g., salinity, drought), and weather stress like high temperatures during flowering. The first step is to maintain proper seedling age and transplant younger seedlings (approximately 20\u201325 days old) to prevent early reproductive transition and ensure better yield potential. Apply sufficient nitrogen fertilizer, especially the second top dressing during the active tillering to panicle initiation stages, to support vegetative growth and delay flowering. Basal dose before\/at transplanting 1\/3rd Nitrogen, that is 22-25 kg urea, which is applied during puddling or immediately after transplanting. In the active tillering stage, 20-25 DAT, 1\/3rd nitrogen is applied, which is 22-25 kg urea. During the panicle initiation at 40-45 DAT, 1\/3rd of the nitrogen, which is around 22\u201325 kg urea.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How should I do urea broadcasting for wheat?","Final Answer":"Urea broadcasting is the most common method of applying urea fertilizer to wheat. The process involves scattering granular urea uniformly over the soil surface. This method is highly effective for delivering nitrogen, an essential nutrient for wheat growth and tillering. The amount of urea and the timing of its application are critical for maximizing yield and nitrogen use efficiency. The total recommended dose is typically around 90 kg of urea per acre. This total amount is split into two equal doses to prevent nitrogen loss and ensure the plant receives the nutrients when it needs them most. Broadcast 45 kg of urea per acre before the first irrigation, and broadcast the remaining 45 kg per acre before the second irrigation, which typically occurs 45\u201355 days after sowing. For wheat sown after mid-December, the dose is slightly reduced; a common recommendation is to broadcast 35 kg of urea per acre with both the first and second irrigations. In some cases, especially in foggy conditions or when irrigation is delayed, a foliar spray of a 2\u20133% urea solution (20 kg urea in 200 litres of water per acre) can be used as an alternative to broadcasting the second dose to improve nutrient uptake."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I reclaim or improve alkaline soil for better crop growth?","Final Answer":"Reclaiming alkaline soil for wheat involves improving soil structure and reducing excess sodium. The primary method is the application of gypsum as a soil amendment. Based on a soil test, finely powdered gypsum is broadcast over the field and mixed into the topsoil. This is followed by heavy irrigation to wash away the sodium. Sow salt-tolerant wheat varieties, and use light and frequent irrigation to prevent waterlogging and salt accumulation on the surface. Apply about 25% more urea (nitrogen) to compensate for losses, and apply zinc sulphate to correct the common zinc deficiency in these soils. Incorporate farmyard manure and crop residues to improve soil health over time."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I register my organic products officially as a farmer?","Final Answer":"To register organic paddy products, you must get certified through one of two government-approved systems: the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) or the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS-India). NPOP: This system is for farmers who want to export their products. You must hire a third-party certification body to inspect your farm. PGS-India: This system is for farmers selling locally. A group of farmers mutually inspects and certifies each other's farms. In both cases, you'll need to undergo a mandatory 24-month transition period without using any synthetic chemicals. You must also keep detailed records of all farming activities. Upon successful inspection, you'll receive a certificate and can use the official India Organic logo."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Whats is Mycorrhiza and its application in soil?","Final Answer":"Mycorrhizae are beneficial fungi that form a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, acting as an extension of the root system. They are widely used as a biofertilizer to enhance nutrient and water uptake, especially phosphorus, and to improve soil health. Mainly farmers grow some major Kharif crops like paddy (rice) and cotton; the application of mycorrhizae is gaining popularity. The most common application method is soil broadcasting. The mycorrhizal inoculant (typically 4-8 kg per acre) is mixed with well-decomposed manure and spread uniformly across the field before sowing or transplanting. Other methods include seed treatment: coating seeds with a slurry of the inoculant before sowing, and drenching: applying a water mixture of the inoculant directly to the soil near the plant's roots. For best results, it's important to apply mycorrhizae early in the crop's life and avoid using high doses of chemical fertilizers at the same time, as they can inhibit the fungi."}

Various systems, such as nutrient film technique (NFT), deep water culture (DWC), and aeroponics, are used depending on the crop type. Hydroponics is especially suitable for growing leafy vegetables, herbs, and certain fruits in urban and indoor settings. Although the initial setup can be expensive and requires technical knowledge, hydroponics offers a sustainable solution for food production with minimal space and resources."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I sow two different varieties of Paddy in same field?","Final Answer":"Mixing two varieties of paddy (rice) in the same field can have both advantages and challenges. This practice helps improve crop growth and protects plants from pests, diseases, and bad weather. If one variety does not do well, the other might still produce a good harvest, making the overall crop more reliable. Different varieties can also use sunlight, water, and nutrients more efficiently together. However, problems can occur when the plants compete for resources like food and space, or if one variety spreads diseases to the other. It can also be difficult to manage and harvest the crop if the two varieties mature at different times. To make this method successful, farmers should carefully select compatible varieties, give them enough space, and take good care of the crop. Many farmers and researchers use this technique to grow healthier crops and learn which varieties perform better."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to manage degraded water having high total soluble solids?","Final Answer":"When water has a lot of salt and minerals dissolved in it, we say it has high Total Soluble Solids (TSS). This kind of water can hurt plants and make the soil bad for growing crops. To fix this problem, farmers can do some things. They can mix salty water with clean water to make it less salty. They can also give extra water to the plants to wash the salt out of the soil. Adding a material called gypsum to the soil helps to keep the soil healthy by stopping bad salts. Good drainage is important too, so the salty water does not stay around the roots. Farmers can also grow special plants that can live in salty water. Sometimes, water is cleaned using filters to remove the salt before using it on crops. By doing these things, farmers can help plants grow well even if the water has a lot of salt."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding formation of panicle","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop; the formation of the ear (panicle initiation) is a very critical stage that directly affects yield. Growth stage-The ear (panicle) initiation stage starts about 55-60 days after transplanting (in early maturing varieties) and a little later in long-duration varieties. The growing point (meristem) changes from vegetative (leaf-producing) to reproductive (panicle-producing). At this stage, the developing panicle is about 1\u20132 mm in size and hidden inside the stem (boot leaf). This is the most critical stage for yield formation. The number of spikelets (potential grains) per panicle is determined at this stage. Moisture stress, nutrient deficiency, or pest attack during this time can drastically reduce yield. Nitrogen (N): Apply top dressing of urea at this stage to ensure healthy panicle development. For example, for PR 126 or PR 121 varieties, a split dose of urea is recommended, with one part specifically at panicle initiation. Potassium (K): Adequate K ensures proper grain filling and reduces the incidence of diseases like brown spot. Zinc: Deficiency around this stage can hinder ear development. Maintain shallow standing water (2\u20133 cm) continuously at this stage. Water stress at panicle initiation can cause reduced tillering, chaffy grains, and spikelet sterility. During ear initiation and the booting stage, leaf folders, stem borers, plant hoppers, sheath blight & false smut, timely monitoring, and control measures are required if threshold levels are crossed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me information regarding Jivanu khad (biofertilizer)?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a rabi season crop. Biofertilizers play an important role in wheat cultivation by enhancing nutrient availability and promoting healthier plant growth. Combining biofertilizers with carriers like sugarcane husk or maize straw can significantly improve plant growth, chlorophyll, sugar and protein content, and antioxidant activities, leading to increased yields. Types of biofertilizers: Azotobacter: These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil, making it available to plants. Phosphorus Solubilising Bacteria (PSB): These microorganisms solubilise insoluble phosphorus compounds in the soil, converting them into a form readily available for plant uptake. Azospirillum: This bacterium helps in nitrogen fixation and promotes plant growth. Sulphur Solubilising Bacteria: These bacteria assist in making sulfur available to plants. Application method: Biofertilizers are typically applied as a seed treatment. Prepare a solution by dissolving 200\u2013300 grams of jaggery in one litre of warm water. Allow the solution to cool, then mix in the contents of the appropriate biofertilizer packet (e.g., Azotobacter for wheat). Evenly coat the wheat seeds with the solution and allow them to dry in the shade. Sow the treated seeds within 12 hours of drying."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding late sown varieties of Paddy","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop, the late-sown variety, PR 126, a short-duration crop, stands out as the main PAU-recommended paddy variety suitable for late Kharif planting in Punjab. Nursery: May 25 - June 20, Transplanting: Up to July 5 (ideally by July 10-15). Key Advice: Use 25-30-day-old seedlings; avoid transplant delays beyond July 15 to preserve yield and milling quality. PR 126 matures in approximately 95 days after transplanting, significantly less than other popular varieties like Pusa-44 (160 days); PR 126 requires around 17-18 irrigations. PR 126 is resistant to bacterial blight disease. The shorter duration of PR 126 produces less straw, which can be advantageous for managing agricultural residue and reducing straw burning. Average yield: 28\u201330 quintals\/acre, with good management-30 quintals\/acre. Grain type: Medium slender, very popular in Punjab due to short duration (123-125 days) and good milling quality. Straw yield: 60\u201365 quintals\/acre (less than long-duration varieties, but enough for fodder)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the consequences of excess nitrogen application?","Final Answer":"Excess nitrogen can cause your wheat plants to become excessively tall and weak, making them prone to lodging (falling over) during strong winds or heavy rain, which drastically reduces your yield. This also makes your crop more susceptible to diseases and pests because excess nitrogen fertilizer causes plants to grow very fast and produce soft, lush, tender leaves. These tender leaves contain more sap, amino acids, and sugars, which act as \u201cready food\u201d for many sucking pests such as aphids, whiteflies, jassids, and leafhoppers, as well as caterpillars. Because the plant tissues remain soft, pests can easily suck or chew them, making the crop more attractive to attacks. Furthermore, excessive nitrogen can harm the quality of your soil by increasing its acidity and reducing its overall health over time, potentially leading to deficiencies in other vital nutrients. It can even lead to nitrate leaching, contaminating groundwater, which can affect human and animal health. To prevent these issues, it is best to base your nitrogen application on soil tests and follow the recommended doses for your specific region and wheat variety, including using balanced and integrated nutrient management with both organic and inorganic sources of nutrients. This will help you achieve good yields and maintain the health of your soil for future generations."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding inspection of field","Final Answer":"Wheat field inspections are vital for protecting crop health and ensuring a successful harvest. These inspections focus on identifying key threats such as rust diseases\u2014especially Yellow Rust and Brown Rust\u2014which can cause severe yield losses if not managed early. Other important diseases include Karnal Bunt, Loose Smut, and Powdery Mildew. Common insect pests include aphids, which suck sap and can transmit diseases; Yellow Stem Borers, which damage seedlings and young tillers; and termites, which attack the root zone and weaken plants. Armyworms and cutworms are also serious pests that can destroy large portions of the crop if left unchecked. Inspections are conducted at all major crop stages, from early growth through to pre-harvest, and also involve checking for off-types\u2014undesirable or genetically different plants that reduce seed purity and grain quality. A key aspect of pest monitoring is the use of Economic Threshold Levels (ETLs) to guide control measures. For example, aphids should be controlled when their population reaches 5\u201310 aphids per earhead. Timely detection and action based on these thresholds are essential to maintain crop health, reduce unnecessary pesticide use, and ensure a high-quality, high-yielding wheat crop."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding biogas waste","Final Answer":"Biogas waste, more accurately called digestate, is a nutrient-rich byproduct of biogas production that is highly beneficial for wheat cultivation. It's essentially a liquid or solid fertilizer loaded with essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Using it reduces the need for expensive chemical fertilizers, improves soil health by adding organic matter, and increases wheat yields. A key benefit is its role in the circular economy: paddy straw\u2014a major source of air pollution from stubble burning\u2014is used to produce biogas, and its waste is then returned to the fields as a valuable, eco-friendly fertilizer for the next wheat crop."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I mix Axial and 2,4-D herbicides, and how should I use them safely on my Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Mixing Axial and 2,4-D herbicides is a common method to control weeds in wheat fields. Axial (Pinoxaden) targets grassy weeds such as Phalaris minor and Avena fatua, while 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) controls broadleaf weeds like Chenopodium, Melilotus, and Amaranthus. When used together, they provide effective control of many weed types with just one spray, saving farmers time, effort, and money. Farmers typically apply this mixture 25 to 35 days after sowing wheat, when the weeds have two to four leaves. The recommended dose is approximately 320\u2013400 ml of Axial and 250\u2013400 ml of 2,4-D per acre, mixed in 160\u2013200 litres of water. A flat-fan nozzle should be used for even spraying. However, there are some risks. 2,4-D can drift with the wind and may damage nearby crops such as mustard, vegetables, or cotton. For tank mixing with Axial in wheat, only the 2,4-D Amine salt formulation should be used, as the Ester formulation is more volatile and carries a higher risk of phytotoxicity. Additionally, some wheat varieties may be damaged if the spray is applied during hot, windy, or rainy conditions. Overuse may also lead to weed resistance, reducing the effectiveness of the spray over time. To use safely, farmers should perform a jar test to ensure the chemicals mix well, use clean water, avoid overlapping sprays, and follow the instructions on the product label or guidance from local agricultural experts."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I mix Axial with Sencor for spraying, and how should I use them safely on my wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Mixing Axial and Sencor herbicides is an effective way to control weeds in wheat fields. Axial (active ingredient: Pinoxaden) kills grassy weeds like Phalaris minor and Avena fatua, while Sencor (active ingredient: Metribuzin) kills broadleaf weeds like Chenopodium and Amaranthus. When used together, they provide broad-spectrum weed control in a single spray, saving both time and money. This mix is usually applied 25 to 35 days after sowing (DAS), when the weeds are at the 2 to 4 leaf stage (early post-emergence). The recommended dose is about 320 to 400 ml per acre of Axial 5 EC and 60 to 80 grams per acre of Sencor 70 WP, mixed in 160 to 200 litres of water per acre for uniform coverage. However, there are some disadvantages. Some wheat varieties, particularly sensitive ones like PBW 725, may be injured by Sencor, especially in light or sandy soils. Overlapping applications or overdosing can harm the crop. Unfavourable weather\u2014such as frost, strong winds, or rain within six hours of spraying\u2014can reduce effectiveness and may cause spray drift to nearby crops. Repeated use of these herbicides can also lead to herbicide resistance. To reduce risk, farmers should perform a jar test (compatibility check), use clean water, and always follow label instructions and local agricultural advisories for safe and effective use."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control snail in paddy ? ","Final Answer":"To manage and control snails in the field, remove weeds, crop residues, and other debris from fields to eliminate snail hiding places. Along with it, planting trap crops like mustard around the main crop to attract snails, which can then be collected and destroyed. Rely on biological control methods, such as natural predators, such as ducks, birds, frogs, and beetles that feed on snails. Chemical control methods involve the application of ferric phosphate 1% as bait, applying 3 to 5 kg per acre, depending on infestation severity. Scatter the bait in small quantities throughout the field, especially near snail habitats like moist shaded areas. Apply during early morning or late evening for better effectiveness.

It is advised to strictly follow the specific product's label, which often states, Do not allow bait to contact edible parts of the plant."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"After irrigation, when should the next watering be avoided?","Final Answer":"The critical stages of irrigation in wheat are those where water stress can cause maximum yield loss.\nThe most important stage is the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage at 20\u201325 days after sowing, which is essential for root development and tillering. The second critical stage is tillering (40\u201345 DAS), when side shoots develop and determine the number of productive tillers.\nThe jointing stage (stem elongation) also requires adequate moisture for healthy crop growth.\nIrrigation at the flowering stage ensures proper pollination and grain set, while irrigation during the grain-filling or milk\/dough stage supports kernel development and prevents shriveled grains.\nHowever, irrigation should be avoided immediately after sowing to prevent seed rotting, as well as just before crop maturity, since excess moisture at this stage can reduce grain quality and delay harvesting. During cloudy days, irrigation must also be avoided to prevent lodging of the crop. The next irrigation in wheat should not be applied immediately after the previous one but only after the soil moisture has been adequately utilized by the crop.\nOn average, wheat requires 4\u20136 irrigations depending on soil type and climate, but CRI, tillering, flowering, and grain filling are considered the most critical for achieving high yield.\nOver-irrigation or excessively frequent watering can lead to waterlogging, poor root growth, and an increased risk of diseases. Specifically, irrigation must be avoided immediately after sowing to prevent seed rotting and just before crop maturity, as excess moisture at that time reduces grain quality and delays harvesting.\n"}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How To Control Wilt In Paddy?","Final Answer":"Wilt in paddy during the Zaid season is chiefly caused by the fungus Fusarium fujikuroi (bakanae disease). It can be managed by seed treatment with Trichoderma viride (@ 4 g per kg of seed) or carbendazim 50% WP (@ 1 g per kg of seed), along with a foliar spray of carbendazim 50% WP at 500 g\/acre. Both Trichoderma and carbendazim are regionally recommended and considered safe for controlling bakanae. Deep summer ploughing is advised to expose sclerotia, while maintaining 5 cm of standing water for 20 days helps suppress soil inoculum. Crop rotation with non-susceptible crops (e.g., maize) for 2 years is also beneficial. The use of bakanae-tolerant varieties such as \u2018CSR 36\u2019 and \u2018Pusa Basmati 1509\u2019 is the first line of defence against bakanae in Haryana. Zaid's paddy cultivation benefits greatly from proper water management and crop rotation, and following these steps helps guide farmers more effectively."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much fertilizers are required for wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat requires nutrients in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, typically supplied through urea, DAP (Diammonium Phosphate), and MOP (Muriate of Potash). Apply 130 kg of Urea, 50 kg of DAP, and 20 kg of MOP per acre. Apply the full amount of DAP and MOP, along with half of the Urea, before sowing. The remaining half of the urea should be applied after the first irrigation, about 20\u201325 days after sowing. This split application of nitrogen ensures better nutrient uptake, reduces losses, and supports healthy crop growth. Using DAP instead of an excessive amount of SSP saves cost and better meets the phosphorus needs of wheat."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Rats in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"While wheat is a Rabi crop, controlling rats is a crucial year-round job, especially for the grain you have in storage right now. For a highly effective bait, carefully mix 1 part Zinc Phosphide with 40 parts of flour or broken grain (for example, 25 grams of poison in 1 kg of flour) and add a little mustard oil to bind it. A safer, ready-made option is to use Bromadiolone (0.005%) cakes; place 1-2 cakes deep inside each active burrow you find around your field or storage area. The total cost to control rats for a one-acre area is usually low, around \u20b9200-300, and the most important rule is to always keep these poisons completely out of reach of children and domestic animals."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowing of leaves in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Yellowing of leaves in your Wheat crop can happen due to different reasons like lack of nutrients, water stress, pest attack, or disease. You don\u2019t need to worry, just check your crop carefully. If the yellowing starts from the bottom leaves and spreads upward, it may be due to Nitrogen deficiency; in such cases, applying Urea with irrigation can help. If the yellowing is seen mostly on the newer leaves, it could be a Sulphur deficiency, for which Gypsum or Sulphur-based fertilizer should be used. If the leaves show yellow and white stripes, then it's likely a Zinc deficiency, and spraying Zinc Sulphate 21% (2.5 g\/l) with lime can help. If yellow patches appear in some parts of the field, check for termite damage at the base of plants or see if the soil is too dry or compacted, which may cause water stress. If you see yellowing with spots or powdery growth, it could be a disease like yellow rust, and spraying Propiconazole 25 EC (200 ml\/acre) by mixing in 200-250 litres of water is recommended. Identifying the right cause early will help you take the correct steps to protect your crop."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Yellow Rust in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Yellow rust in wheat appears as yellow-orange powdery streaks on leaves and can spread rapidly in the cool, humid weather of January-February, severely reducing your grain yield. It is crucial to monitor your fields weekly, especially during the critical period from tillering to the booting stage. While using resistant varieties like HD-3086 and WH-1105 is the best prevention, you must spray a fungicide at the very first sign of the disease. To manage resistance, rotate between effective chemicals like Propiconazole 25% EC at 200 ml per acre or Tebuconazole 25.9% EC at 200 ml per acre. Both of these are mixed in 200 -250 litres of water to ensure full coverage. For severe infections, a modern combination product like Azoxystrobin + Tebuconazole is also highly effective. For safety, you must observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 30-35 days after spraying before harvesting the crop."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowness in Paddy leaves?","Final Answer":"Yellowing in paddy leaves may be due to several reasons, such as nutrient deficiency (nitrogen, zinc, iron, magnesium), water stress, and pest and disease attack, so proper diagnosis is key for control. If yellowing symptoms appear on older leaves on the lower side with poor tillering, then it is due to nitrogen deficiency. To correct this, apply urea at 35-50 kg per acre as top dressing, or you can apply a foliar spray of 2% urea solution (20 grams per litre of water). If yellowing appears on younger leaves while the veins remain green, it is due to iron deficiency. To correct this, use a foliar spray of ferrous sulphate 0.5% (5 grams per litre of water) 2-3 times at 15-day intervals. If yellowing symptoms appear on lower leaves with a brown, rusty appearance during the early stage, it may be due to zinc deficiency. To correct this, use a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulphate solution(5 grams zinc sulphate + 2.5 grams slaked lime per litre of water). Water stress or over-irrigation can cause yellowing in paddy leaves. To control this, maintain a 2-3 cm water level in the field, especially during the early growth stage, and avoid over-irrigation or long dry spells. If the symptoms are characterized by water-soaked spots that turn yellow along leaf margins and dry, then it may be due to bacterial blight disease. To control this, apply streptocycline (1 gram per 10 litres of water) + copper oxychloride (2-3 grams per litre of water)."}

When selecting the best variety you can go with, HD 123 is a reliable performer, as it is resistant against sticky insects and gives a yield of up to 10-12 q\/acre. Also, there is a new variety, HD 432, which is excellent. It has a better staple length, which means you get a better price, and it has a high ginning outturn of around 38-40% (staple length is up to 27-28 mm). Its natural tolerance to pests can save you at least 1-2 insecticide sprays compared to hybrid cotton."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to correct Zinc deficiency in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Zinc deficiency in Paddy leads to Khaira disease. To avoid this deficiency apply 10 kg Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) in per acre of area before transplanting or sowing of Paddy. If the zinc deficiency occurs in your standing crop, then spray zinc sulphate (5 g\/l) with lime on the leaves."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Zinc deficiency in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Zinc deficiency is common due to the alkaline and high pH soils. To improve zinc application in your soil, I apply zinc sulphate (ZnSO\u2084) 10-15 kg per acre mixed with well-decomposed FYM, and apply at the time of sowing. Or you can give zinc sulphate foliar spray 1 kg\/acre in 200 litres of water, or chelated zinc 12% @ 500 g\/acre in 200 litres of water at the time of tillering and flowering stage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the deficiency of Zinc","Final Answer":"Zinc deficiency in wheat is commonly observed in light or sandy soils, especially in fields where no organic manure is used. Affected plants show symptoms like stunted growth, bushy appearance, and yellowing or bleaching of younger leaves. To prevent this, apply Zinc Sulphate at 10 kg per acre as a basal dose at the time of sowing. However, if the field was previously under paddy and zinc was already applied in that crop, there is usually no need to reapply zinc in the following wheat crop. In case zinc deficiency symptoms appear in the standing crop, a curative measure can be taken by spraying a foliar solution of Zinc Sulphate (21%) at 500 grams per acre mixed with 250 grams of slaked lime in 200 liters of water. This spray can be repeated after 10\u201315 days if needed. Timely correction of zinc deficiency is crucial for proper tillering and optimal yield in wheat."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Fruit borer in Brinjal?","Final Answer":"Fruit borer in brinjal (Leucinodes orbonalis) is a big headache for farmers, as it makes small holes in fruits and also damages young shoots, resulting in a drop in yield, and the market price also goes down. If you want a good crop and a good income, you have to manage it from the start with full care. First of all, keep your field neat, regularly pluck and destroy damaged fruits and shoots so the pest cycle is broken. Never grow brinjal again and again on the same land; instead, rotate with maize, pulses, or wheat. Keep enough spacing in the field - around 60 cm between rows and 45 cm between plants within a row - so that air and sunlight reach plants properly. For natural control, release Trichogramma egg parasitoids @ 50,000 per acre once in 15 days; these tiny wasps kill fruit borer eggs themselves. Also, you spray Neem oil 1% @ 1200 ml per acre or NSKE (Neem Seed Kernel Extract) 5% @ 10 litres per acre. These are safe and reduce pests without harming beneficial insects. When pest pressure is high, use safe and recommended chemicals, as you can use Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre in 200\u2013250 litres water, it is very effective and safe for friendly insects. as an alternative also you can use Emamectin benzoate 5% SG @ 80-81 g per acre or Spinosad 48 EC @ 50 ml per acre in 200\u2013250 litres water. Remember, PHI (waiting period before harvest) is 3 days and 3-4 days for Spinosad. Always rotate these chemicals; don\u2019t repeat the same one, otherwise pests will become resistant. Treat seed with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g per kg seed, it saves plants from soil fungus and makes them stronger against soil-borne disease. Do soil testing in your KVK or JNKVV lab so you can apply fertilisers properly, and healthy plants tolerate pests much better. If we follow all these steps together - clean field, crop rotation, neem and Trichogramma for bio-control, and take timely action, then fruit borer can be controlled very well. Always check the field regularly, spray on time, and never overdose. This way, our brinjal crop will stay healthy, the fruits will be clean, and you will get a good yield and profit."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Yellow Mosaic in Moong(Green gram)?","Final Answer":"Yellow mosaic disease (YMD) in moong fields comes because of a virus spread by whitefly insects. Once a plant gets it, the leaves show yellow patches, growth stops, pods remain empty, and yield goes down badly. To control this, first work on clean farming: remove and burn infected plants quickly, do not grow moong or other pulses again and again on the same land, rotate with wheat, maize, or oilseeds, and put yellow sticky traps (at 15 traps per acre) to catch whiteflies early. Always go for resistant varieties like JNKV 2, Samrat, or Pusa Vishal as recommended by JNKVV and RVSKVV, because they tolerate the disease better. For protection from the start, treat the seed with Imidacloprid 600 FS at 5 ml per kg of seed, and also with Trichoderma viride at 4 g\/kg of seed to keep seedlings strong. For chemical control, you can apply a foliar spray of Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 50 ml per acre in 100\u2013125 liters of water or Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 40 g per acre, or as an alternative, you can also use Acetamiprid 20 SP at 30 g per acre, both of these mixed in 150\u2013200 liters of water for even spraying. Do spray at 15 and 30 days after sowing, and repeat only if whiteflies are seen. Spray early morning or evening to save pollinators, and keep a 15-day gap, and for Imidacloprid 17.8% SL on pulses, it is 21 days before harvest after the last spray, but also follow the withdrawal period label as mentioned. Along with this, spray neem oil (2 ml per liter of water) or NSKE 5% to reduce whitefly safely and cut down on chemicals. Always do soil testing at KVK or a university lab and follow balanced fertilizer, because excess nitrogen makes crops weak and pest attacks heavy. If you keep your fields clean, rotate crops, use resistant varieties, treat seeds, add neem, and, if needed, spray approved chemicals in time, then yellow mosaic disease can be managed well, crops will stay healthy, and yields will be safe."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Termites in Wheat?","Final Answer":"In our wheat crop, the termite problem is very dangerous, because these insects eat roots and stems from inside, and plants start drying patch by patch. Even after good sowing, you may get a poor stand and low yield. To control them properly, first follow clean and timely farming\u2014don\u2019t leave old stubbles and weeds in the field, use only well-rotted manure, do timely sowing instead of late sowing, and if possible, rotate wheat with non-host crops like pulses or oilseeds. This reduces termite buildup. Along with that, mix neem cake at 100 kg per acre in soil at sowing; it not only repels termites but also improves soil health. For seed safety, always do seed treatment\u2014either with Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 6 ml\/kg seed (but applied only under expert guidance as it has some restrictions), or, for a modern, safer option, you can use Bifenthrin 10 EC at 6 ml\/kg seed or Imidacloprid 600 FS at 2 ml\/kg seed. This gives early-stage protection. For standing crops, the best is to apply Fipronil 0.3% granules at 10 - 12 kg per acre in soil at sowing time; it stays longer and protects plants throughout. If a termite attack still appears later, apply Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 1.0 to 1.2 liters per acre, mixed in about 200 to 250 liters of water, sprayed on soil around the base of wheat plants for termite attack control, and for localized soil application, the typical dose is 1.2 liters per acre mixed in 50 kg of moist soil and broadcast near the root zone, when adjusted for area. (but applied only under expert guidance, as it has under some restrictions), Also, as an alternative for this purpose, you can use Deltamethrin, about 40\u201360 ml per acre, depending on how heavy the termite pressure is. Mix this well and spray with 200\u2013250 liters of water per acre so that the soil around plants gets fully wet. The correct method is to do it as a soil drench or band spray near the root zone, because termites stay underground and feed on roots; it is safe, and sometimes it's used for combined IPM. If you do light irrigation after spraying, the medicine goes deeper into the soil and gives a better kill. Always remember to wear gloves and a mask (PPE) while mixing and spraying, and never spray in very hot weather because the crop can get stressed. Also, keep at least a 30-day gap (PHI) between the last spray and harvesting to keep the grain safe, and follow the withdrawal period on the label. For biological safety, treat the seed with Trichoderma viride at 4 g\/kg seed, which makes the seedlings stronger and reduces soil-borne issues. Also, do soil testing at KVK or university labs every 2 years, because balanced fertilizer keeps the crop healthy and less prone to termite attack, while excess nitrogen makes the soil attractive for pests. If we manage in an integrated way\u2014clean field, timely sowing, neem cake, resistant practices, seed treatment, proper control method\u2014then termites can be kept fully under control, and you can get a strong plant stand, healthy crop, and good wheat yield with less tension."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Thrips in Chilli?","Final Answer":"In our chilli crop, the thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis) are very dangerous; they suck the sap from leaves and young fruits, which makes leaves curl, fruits get scars, and the yield goes down badly. To control them properly in Madhya Pradesh fields, it is best to follow a mixed approach\u2014cultural, biological, and chemical control methods. First, keep the field clean and remove weeds around the crop because weeds give shelter to thrips. Also, avoid chili after sorghum since thrips increase there. Intercropping with agathi (Sesbania) also helps. For natural protection, apply neem oil 1500 ppm at 2 ml per liter of water spray and use Katyayani Triple Attack bio agent at 2 liters per acre, spraying with 200 to 250 liters of water per acre for good coverage. These reduce thrips without harming the soil. For seed safety, treat the seed with Trichoderma viride at 4 g\/kg seed before sowing, so plants start strong. Now, for strong attacks, chemicals are needed, but you should rotate to avoid resistance. The best and safest spray is Spinosad 45% SC at 55\u201365 ml per acre in 200\u2013250 liters of water (maintain PHI 7 days). If pressure is high, spray Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 40\u201350 ml per acre mixed in 200-250 liters of water. For dual action and as an alternative, you can use Katyayani Nashak (Fipronil 40% + Imidacloprid 40% WG) at 40\u201360 g per acre in 200\u2013250 liters of water, which works both by contact and systemically and also controls whiteflies along with thrips. Another good option against resistant pests is Diafenthiuron 40.1% + Acetamiprid 3.9% WP at 200\u2013250 g per acre mixed in the same volume of water. Spray well on both sides of the leaves. Always keep a PHI gap of 7\u201310 days for Imidacloprid 17.8% SL and Diafenthiuron 40.1% + Acetamiprid 3.9% WP in chilies before harvest (and 15\u201330 days for heavy products like Fipronil mixes (Fipronil 40% + Imidacloprid 40% WG) if the label says so). Also, for soil health, apply neem cake in the soil and do soil testing at the KVK or JNKVV lab for balanced fertilizer, because healthy plants tolerate thrips better. So, following these easy steps, like combining clean fields, neem and bio agents, seed treatment, and timely rotation of sprays, you can keep thrips under control, fruits will be clean and shining, and yield will be high."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to increase milk production in Buffalo?","Final Answer":"If you want more milk from buffalo, you have to take care of three main things: good feeding, proper health, and right management. First of all, for feeding, always give green fodder in a good amount, like maize, bajra, cowpea in kharif and berseem in rabi, provide 1 kg of concentrate feed for every 2 to 2.5 litres of milk produced, in addition to the maintenance ration, because these give both protein and energy. If you grow improved varieties like cowpea Pusa Vishal, berseem Jaypee Super, or maize HQPM1\/HQPM4, then the buffalo gets better nutrition, and milk increases naturally. Along with this, feed some concentrate mixture with oil cakes and grains, and keep a urea molasses mineral block (UMMB) in the shed, so buffalo can lick and digest better. A regular mineral mixture with calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium must also be given because minerals directly affect milk flow. Nowadays, bypass protein and bypass fat supplements (like Megalac) are also available. If given 100 g\u2013200 g daily with feed, it helps buffalo to produce more milk without weakness, but only under veterinary guidance. For health care, never miss vaccination and deworming as told by NDVSUV vets and give as per vet guidance, because if the buffalo is free from worms and disease, then she eats properly and converts feed into milk. Keep the shed clean, give fresh water always, and in summer, provide shade or a cool water bath, because stress reduces milk. For breeding, use artificial insemination (AI) with good Murrah or Bhadawari semen from government centres, so that the next generation is high-yielding. Along with this, feeding probiotics and yeast culture is also useful to improve digestion and rumen activity, which also pushes milk upward. By following these steps, you are getting much more milk and profit."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Semilooper in Soybean?","Final Answer":"In our soybean crop, the semilooper is a very dangerous problem; its small green larvae eat the leaves from the edge and make big holes, and when the attack is more severe, the whole field looks like jali. The crop cannot do photosynthesis properly, and the yield goes down badly. To fight this pest, it is best to use integrated control\u2014cultural, biological, and chemical\u2014all together in the right way. First thing, keep the field clean, remove weeds and old crop residue where these larvae hide, and do summer deep ploughing so that the pupae inside the soil come out and die in the sun's heat. Rotate soybean with other crops like chana or wheat, and if possible, sow soybean at the proper time so that the peak attack period is avoided. For a biological way, use Bt powder (Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki) spray at 300\u2013400 g per acre in the early stage; this kills small larvae safely, and also neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) 5% spray is very effective for early populations. Along with this, natural enemies like spiders, wasps, and ladybird beetles also control larvae, so avoid unnecessary spraying, which kills these friends. If the pressure is high, then you can spray Profenophos 50 EC 500 ml per acre in 200 liters of water (0.125% solution) or Chlorpyriphos 20 EC 400 ml per acre (0.1%) (applied only under expert guidance, as it hassome restrictions), and as an alternative, Quinalphos 25 EC 200 ml per acre can be used in the same way. Always spray uniformly, covering both sides of leaves, and remember the 15\u201320 day pre-harvest interval before harvesting. For a safer alternative, use emamectin benzoate 5% SG at 12-15 g per acre in 200 liters of water or chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at 100-120 ml per acre in 200 liters of water. If infestation is severe, repeat the spray after 10-15 days, covering both leaf surfaces uniformly. Maintain a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 15-20 days before harvesting. Before sowing, treat soybean seeds with Trichoderma viride 4 g\/kg seed to keep plants healthy from the start, and do soil testing in the KVK\/JNKVV lab to apply balanced khad, because a strong plant resists pests naturally. By following these steps, you can easily control this pest and save your crop, and get a high yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"In the wheat crop, weeds eat fertilizer, water, and sunlight before our crop can take them, so the yield goes down. That is why proper weed control is very important. First of all, always use clean seed that is free from weed seeds, and do timely sowing so that wheat grows fast and suppresses the weeds. In summer, do one or two deep ploughings so that the weed seeds and roots come up and die in sunlight, and you can also use the stale seedbed technique \u2014 wet the soil to germinate weeds and then kill them before sowing. Crop rotation and keeping the field clean are also very useful. In biological methods, mulching with residues keeps weeds suppressed, and wheat varieties with better ground cover also check weed growth. In chemical methods, you can use a combined herbicide like Clodinafop-propargyl and  Metsulfuron-methyl (25 + 1.5 g per acre) and Sulfosulfuron and Metsulfuron-methyl (12 + 0.8 g per acre), which control both grassy and broadleaf weeds. If grassy weeds are heavy, you can use Isoproturon 400 g\/acre or Clodinafop 60 ml\/acre. Among new and safer options, Pinoxaden 75 ml\/acre works very well, and for broad-spectrum control, Sulfosulfuron 12\u201315 g\/acre is effective; all of these you can mix with 200-250 liters of water to ensure even spraying. For early weed prevention, Pendimethalin 1 litre\/acre as a pre-emergence spray is very useful, mixed in 200 - 250 liters of water. Always spray 20\u201330 days after sowing and stop spraying at least 30 days before harvest to keep the crop safe. Seed treatment is also important \u2014 coat seeds with approved fungicide to ensure healthy crop emergence, and get soil testing done from KVK or JNKVV labs to apply the right balance of fertilizer, because a strong crop can naturally suppress weed pressure. By following these steps, your field will remain clean, the crop will grow fast, and the wheat yield will be high."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Stem borer in Paddy?","Final Answer":"In paddy crops, the stem borer is a very dangerous pest because it makes dead hearts and white ear heads, and that cuts our yield badly, so you have to fight it from the start with a full mix of methods. First, use resistant varieties like CR Dhan 802, IR50, Chandina, CR Dhan 308, and Jayantidhan because they are tested and recommended by JNKVV, RVSKVV and ICAR-NRRI. Then do deep summer ploughing so the pupae come out in the sun and die. Before transplanting, clip the tips of seedlings to remove egg masses. Also, keep removing and burning dead hearts from the field, keep the water level proper, not stagnant, and put 4\u20135 light traps per acre to catch moths at night. For the release of Trichogramma japonicum cards at 20,000\/acre every week during egg-laying season, you can also spray Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) at 200\u2013250 g\/acre in 200 litres of water to kill small larvae. Or use neem seed kernel extract 5% made fresh at home. If the pest is still heavy, then go for chemicals. In that case, you can use Cartap Hydrochloride 4% GR at 4\u20135 kg\/acre, broadcast at 20\u201325 days after transplanting, followed by irrigation. Or, as an alternative, you can also use Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at 40\u201360 ml\/acre in 200 liters of water for strong systemic control. If the infestation is still high, then you can use Fipronil 5% SC at 300\u2013400 ml\/acre spray in 200 litres of water, which is good for high infestation. Always spray between 20 and 30 DAT (days after transplanting) when the pest is active and use 200\u2013250 liters of water per acre for uniform coverage. Never repeat the same chemical every time, but rotate them. Always spray only when dead hearts cross 5%, and keep in mind harvest safety gaps like Cartap 21 days, Chlorantraniliprole 20 days, Fipronil 21 days, and Phorate 30 days. Also, treat seeds with approved chemicals and do soil testing at KVK and authorized labs so plants stay strong. If you follow this integrated way with resistant variety, summer ploughing, light traps, neem, and Trichogramma, plus the correct chemical in the right dose and time, then the stem borer will stay under control, and the paddy crop will give you a good green yield without loss."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control flower dropping in Papaya?","Final Answer":"In papaya crops, flower dropping happens due to many reasons together, mainly due to water stress (either drought or waterlogging), nutrient imbalance (lack of nitrogen, boron, calcium, and potassium; then the plant cannot make strong flowers, especially boron and calcium deficiency directly breaks fruit setting), unfavorable weather (cold, heat 20\u201333\u00b0C with 70\u201385% humidity, strong winds), poor pollination, pests and diseases (thrips, aphids, mites, mildew, and ring spot), and wrong practices (poor drainage, excess fertilizer or pesticide, and too many male plants). First thing, keep watering regularly and evenly, neither too much nor too little, especially in the flowering stage, and make sure the field has good drainage. Also, protect plants from strong winds with barriers and do light pruning of extra branches so the plant does not take stress. Also, keep the orchard clean and remove weeds, and if it is the dioecious type, then remove extra male plants after pollination. For nutrition, foliar spray Boron 20% EDTA at 1 g per liter of water (200 liters per acre) at flowering and fruit set time, and if calcium or zinc deficiency is present, then give Zinc Sulphate 100 g per acre (0.5 g\/liter) along with this mix. Add half the quantity of slaked lime to prevent leaf burn and mix with 200 liters of water per acre for full leaf coverage. For boron deficiency, you can use Borax Spray 200 g per acre (0.1 g\/liter) with 200 liters of water per acre. Also use Azospirillum + Phosphobacteria. Apply 20 g per plant at planting and again at 6 months; for typical papaya density (900\u20131000 plants\/acre), use 18\u201320 kg\/acre of each. Mix well-rotted FYM\/compost and broadcast in the root zone, or use as a soil drench with plenty of water. If pests like thrips, aphids, or mites attack, then spray Imidacloprid 17.8% SL 40-60 ml per acre (0.7\u20131 ml\/liter) with 200 liters of water per acre. If a fungal disease like powdery mildew comes, then spray Mancozeb 75 WP 400 g per acre in 200 liters of water per acre for full coverage on leaves\/stems. Do not use growth regulators without expert advice; it is better to depend on nutrition and irrigation. Before sowing, treat the seed with Trichoderma viride 4 g\/kg seed to prevent fungal disease and soil-borne disease. Always test soil in the KVK or JNKVV lab to balance nutrients, especially boron, calcium, and zinc. For varieties, go with Red Lady, Pusa Dwarf, CO-7, Arka Prabhath, and Madhubindu, which have shown good fruit retention and yield in MP. Always remember to spray in the early morning or evening for better effect, follow the correct dose and water volume per acre, rotate chemicals if sprays are repeated, and maintain a harvest gap of 10\u201314 days after spraying. Other Tips: Intercrop with flowering plants (e.g., marigold, sunflower) in papaya rows and keep 1\u20132 honeybee boxes per acre for better fruit set. If you follow these steps, then your papaya will keep more flowers, set more fruits, and give you good profit with a healthy orchard."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the varieties of Coriander?","Final Answer":"Coriander is a very profitable crop, but the season and variety choice make a big difference in yield and income. In the Jayad season, the best sowing time is March-June. Coriander grows nicely when there is moderate temperature and some humidity. At this time, varieties like Rajendra Swati from JNKVV give very good results because they are resistant to stem gall and powdery mildew, give around 12\u201314 quintals of seed per acre, and have a strong aroma. Along with this, Suguna (LCC-236) is also good\u2014it finishes in 90\u201395 days, has high essential oil content, and gives both seed and green leaf, so it is a double benefit. Another option is Suruchi (LCC-234), which gives more green leaves, approximately 18.2 quintals per acre or 1.82 tonnes per acre, and can be grown even in the off-season, so it fits well in Jayad also, and approximately 61\u201373 quintals per acre in the rabi season with proper management. But, if you want to grow in the Rabi season, then the best sowing time is mid-October to mid-November; coriander gives maximum yield because of the cool climate. And if you want to grow in the Kharif season, then the best sowing time is July-August. The same varieties, like Rajendra Swati, Suguna, and Suruchi, plus CO-1 and CO-2, perform well. In Rabi, crops mature in 90\u2013110 days, and yield can go up to 10 quintals per acre due to better seed setting. For both seasons, the seed rate is 8\u201310 kg per acre, and spacing should be maintained at 30 cm between rows and 10\u201315 cm between plants to ensure proper growth and airflow. Harvesting time is 90\u2013110 days, depending on the variety. When cultivated using scientific techniques, irrigated crops produce 6.1\u20137.3 quintals of seeds and 40.5\u201350.6 quintals of leaves per acre, whereas unirrigated crops produce 2.0\u20132.8 quintals per acre. Before sowing, prepare the seedbed well with light harrowing, treat the seeds with Trichoderma at 4 g\/kg to avoid seed-borne diseases, and do soil testing at the KVK or JNKVV lab for proper nutrition.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control diseases in Buffalo?","Final Answer":"Controlling disease in buffaloes requires a comprehensive management strategy focused on prevention, vigilance, and prompt treatment. This approach is often termed biosecurity and is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive environment. A strict vaccination schedule is the first and most crucial line of defense against common infectious diseases. All buffaloes must be vaccinated against endemic diseases like Hemorrhagic Septicemia (HS) and Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD). Follow the advice of a veterinarian to create a vaccination calendar tailored to your farm and region. New animals introduced to the herd should be quarantined for at least two to three weeks. This isolation period allows for observing the new animal for any signs of illness before it mixes with the rest of the herd. Maintaining impeccable hygiene in the shed and surroundings is non-negotiable. The animal shed should be clean, dry, well-ventilated, and protected from extreme weather. Clean the shed daily to remove manure, soiled bedding, and leftover feed. Ensure proper drainage around the shed to prevent waterlogging, which attracts parasites and mosquitoes. Disinfect the shed and feeding troughs regularly with recommended disinfectants. Provide a balanced diet with adequate minerals, as nutritional deficiencies can make animals more susceptible to infections. Ensure a constant supply of clean, fresh drinking water. Implement a regular deworming program for both internal and external parasites, as advised by a veterinarian. Conduct regular health check-ups for early detection of any problems. Monitor the animals daily for any signs of illness, such as reduced feed intake, dullness, isolation from the herd, high body temperature, coughing, lameness, or abnormal discharge. Isolate any sick animal immediately to prevent the disease from spreading to healthy ones. Always contact a qualified veterinarian as soon as you notice any abnormal signs."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Damping off in Tomato?","Final Answer":"Damping-off is a destructive fungal disease that affects tomato seedlings during both the pre-emergence and post-emergence stages. For chemical seed treatment, fungicides such as Thiram or Captan can be used at a dose of 2 to 3 grams per kilogram of seed. As a biological alternative, Trichoderma viride can be applied at 5 to 10 grams per kilogram of seed, by thoroughly coating the seeds with the powder before sowing. Soil treatment is also crucial for preventing damping-off in the nursery bed. For chemical soil drenching, prepare a 0.3% solution of Copper Oxychloride by mixing 3 grams per liter of water, and apply it thoroughly to the nursery bed before sowing. Alternatively, a biological soil treatment can be done using Trichoderma viride, applied at a rate of 1 to 1.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 100 kilograms of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM). This mixture should be incorporated into the topsoil of the nursery bed one week before sowing. Another effective method is soil solarization, which involves covering a pre-watered nursery bed with a transparent plastic sheet for 3 to 4 weeks. This process uses solar heat to sterilize the top layer of soil and helps eliminate soil-borne pathogens. After the seedlings emerge, proper watering and nursery management are essential to prevent the disease. If any disease symptoms appear, infected seedlings should be immediately removed and destroyed. For chemical control in such cases, drench the soil around the healthy seedlings with a solution of either Propamocarb Hydrochloride or Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP, at a dose of 2 to 2.5 grams per liter of water."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Rats in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a Rabi crop all over India; controlling rats is a crucial year-round job, especially for the grain you have in storage right now. For a highly effective bait, carefully mix 1 part zinc phosphide with 40 parts of flour or broken grain (for example, 25 grams of poison in 1 kg of flour) and add a little mustard oil to bind it. A safer, ready-made option is to use Bromadiolone (0.005%) cakes; place 1-2 cakes deep inside each active burrow you find around your field or storage area. The total cost to control rats for a one-acre area is usually low, around 200-300. Also, you can place the non-poisoned bait for 2-3 days before using the poisoned bait. This prevents \"bait shyness\" and ensures rodents consume a lethal dose, and the most important rule is to always keep these poisons completely out of reach of children and domestic animals."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is a Kisan Credit Card?\n\n","Final Answer":"The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is a vital government initiative to provide timely and adequate credit to farmers. It is designed to meet their short-term credit needs for cultivation, post-harvest expenses, and other domestic requirements. The scheme is implemented by all major banks, including nationalized banks, cooperative banks, and regional rural banks operating in Madhya Pradesh. The primary objective is to offer farmers flexible and simplified access to credit at concessional interest rates. The KCC covers farmers who are individual or joint borrowers engaged in cultivation and other allied activities. The credit limit is decided based on the area of holding, cropping pattern, and scale of finance. The card also provides eligibility for cash credit withdrawals to meet various agricultural expenses. A significant benefit is the interest subvention offered by the central government. Farmers who repay their loans on time are eligible for a subsidy, which effectively reduces the interest rate. The scheme also provides coverage for accidental death and disability of the cardholder. The Kisan Credit Card can be used to meet the investment credit needs for allied activities like dairy, poultry, and fisheries. The repayment period is typically aligned with the harvesting and marketing period for the crops. To apply for a KCC, a farmer needs to approach their nearest bank branch with which they have an account. Required documents usually include proof of identity, proof of residence, land records, and passport-sized photographs. The application form is available at the bank branch and must be filled out with the necessary details. The bank then verifies the documents and the land records before sanctioning the limit. The credit limit is sanctioned for a period of up to five years, subject to an annual review. The card can be used at bank branches and ATMs to withdraw cash as per the sanctioned limit. For most banks, there is no processing fee or annual fee for the Kisan Credit Card. The scheme has been a cornerstone in ensuring credit flow to the agriculture sector in Madhya Pradesh. It has helped farmers avoid reliance on informal moneylenders who charge exorbitant interest rates. For the most accurate and detailed information, farmers should visit their local bank branch. They can also contact the District Lead Bank Manager or the Office of the District Agriculture Officer for guidance. The official website of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) also provides detailed operational guidelines for the scheme."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Fruit and Flower Dropping in Lemon plants?","Final Answer":"Fruit and flower dropping in lemon trees is a common physiological disorder with multiple potential causes. Water stress is a major contributing factor during the hot summer months. Provide consistent irrigation through drip systems to maintain even soil moisture and prevent drought stress. Nutritional deficiencies are a primary cause, particularly a lack of nitrogen, potassium, and micronutrients. A soil test is highly recommended to identify specific nutrient deficiencies in your orchard. For micronutrients, foliar sprays are very effective during flowering and fruit set. Spray a solution of zinc sulfate at 0.5%, which is 5 g\/liter of water. Spray Borax at 0.1%, which is 1 gm\/liter of water, to address boron deficiency. A high-potassium fertilizer spray like 13:0:45 at 4-5 gm\/liter can strengthen fruit retention. Pest attacks from insects like citrus leaf miners or mites can directly cause fruit drop. Diseases such as citrus canker or root rot also weaken the tree and lead to dropping. Monitor trees regularly for early signs of pest infestation or disease. For control, spray acetamiprid at 0.3 g\/liter or imidacloprid at 0.5 ml\/liter for sucking pests. For fungal issues, use Hexaconazole at 1 ml\/liter of water as a spray. Hormonal imbalance, specifically low auxin levels, can trigger the fruit drop mechanism. A foliar spray of Planofix (NAA 4.5% SL), with a dose of 1 ml of product mixed in 4.5 liters of water to achieve the desired concentration. Protect trees from extreme environmental stress like hot, dry winds by planting windbreak trees."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control milk fever in Buffalo?","Final Answer":"Milk fever, also known as hypocalcemia, is a metabolic disorder that primarily affects buffaloes around the time of calving. It is caused by a sudden drop in the blood calcium level, as a large amount of calcium is rapidly mobilized from the blood to produce colostrum. First, prevention is necessary, and if disease symptoms appear, treatment is recommended. Preventive measures: Feed low-calcium diets during the last 2-3 weeks before calving to stimulate calcium mobilization, feed acidifying rations by adding anionic salts (like calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate) to balance dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD), add limestone to drinking water before calving, avoid excessive calcium during late pregnancy, and provide vitamin D supplements prepartum to enhance calcium absorption. Treatment: If prevention fails and a buffalo shows signs of milk fever, immediate and proper treatment is essential to prevent it from progressing to a more severe stage, which can lead to coma and death. Use calcium borogluconate intravenously at 400-500 mL slowly into the jugular vein for rapid correction. Supportive therapies include intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline and dextrose solution to correct dehydration and energy deficits, along with intramuscular injections of vitamin B complex and metabolic stimulants like tonophosphan. After the IV treatment, or for mild cases in the early stages where the buffalo is still standing, an oral calcium bolus or gel can be given to prevent a relapse.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellow leaf in Garlic?","Final Answer":"Before you can control the problem, you need to find its root cause. Monitor for other symptoms along with yellowing of leaves. Nutrient deficiency, especially nitrogen, is a common cause of yellowing of leaves, where yellowing typically starts from the tips of the older leaves and moves downward. Fungal diseases like purple blotch and stemphylium blight can cause yellow leaves. In the case of purple blotch disease, symptoms start with water-soaked, pale yellow spots in leaves that turn brown or black, and Stemphylium blight disease causes small, yellow sunken lesions on leaves that enlarge into leaves withering. Thrips is a sap-sucking insect that can cause leaves to curl and turn yellow, particularly during a dry period and water stress. A combination of extreme cold and extreme hot weather may cause yellow leaves in garlic. If the yellowing is due to nutrient deficiency, apply 1 kg NPK 19:19:19 per acre to quickly correct nitrogen deficiency, always apply urea based on soil test recommendation, and add 25 kg sulfur along with the recommended fertilizer before sowing. Irrigate the crop frequently during dry periods, but avoid overwatering, as garlic cannot withstand waterlogging situations. Diseases like purple blotch and stemphylium blight can cause yellow leaves. To control this, spray Mancozeb 75 WP at 2.5 grams per liter of water (PHI 7 days) or Propiconazole 25 EC at 1 ml per liter of water (PHI 14\u201330 days) or Copper Oxychloride 50 WP at 3 ml per liter of water (PHI 2\u201310 days) at 10\u201315 day intervals. To control thrips, which can cause yellow leaves, remove weeds and plant debris, and apply neem oil at 5 ml per liter of water at 7-10 day intervals during early infestation. In case of severe infestation, apply Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 0.3 ml per liter of water (PHI 14 days, check label) or Fipronil 5% SC at 1 ml per liter of water (PHI 7-14 days, check label)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is KCC and its advantages to the farmers?","Final Answer":"The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is a central government scheme designed to provide timely and adequate credit support to farmers for their agricultural and allied activities. It is available to all types of farmers, including owner farmers, tenant farmers, Self Help Groups (SHGs), and Joint Liability Groups (JLGs). Farmers can use the loan amount for purchasing seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery, dairy, poultry, fisheries, goatery, and even limited household needs. The loan limit is decided based on landholding, cropping pattern, and scale of finance fixed by the District Level Technical Committee (DLTC). Loan amounts start from around \u20b910,000 to \u20b950,000 for small and marginal farmers and go up to \u20b93\u20135 lakhs or more, depending on requirements. The normal interest rate is 7% per annum, but farmers who repay on time may get a 3% interest subvention, so the effective interest rate becomes only 4%. The repayment period is one year for short-term crop loans and 3\u20135 years for term loans like tractors, pump sets, or dairy units. For loans up to \u20b91.6 lakh, generally no collateral is required, while higher loans may need land documents as security.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control red Pumpkin beetle?","Final Answer":"Pumpkin is grown primarily during the Kharif (monsoon) season, with sowing in June-July. It can also be cultivated during the summer season (February-March) with irrigation. The red pumpkin beetle (Aulacophora foveicollis) is a major pest of pumpkin. It's a shiny, reddish-orange beetle, about 5-8 mm long. Both the adult beetles and their grubs cause damage. Adults feed voraciously on the leaves, flowers, and fruits, creating large, irregular holes. This can defoliate and even kill young seedlings, often necessitating re-sowing. Larvae (grubs) live in the soil and feed on roots and stems, which can lead to wilting and plant death. To control them, remove and destroy crop debris and weeds that can harbor the beetles. Plant highly preferred crops like bottle gourd or cucumber as trap crops to attract the beetles, then treat those specific plants with an insecticide. Sprinkle wood ash or a mixture of lime and wood ash on the plants, as this can deter the beetles. After harvest, deep plowing of the field exposes the grubs and pupae to sunlight and predators. Or you can give seed treatment of Imidacloprid 70% WG at 3-4 grams per kg of seed. Or give a spray of Spinosad 45% SC at 60-75 ml per acre (PHI- 3 days), Thiamethoxam+Lambda-cyhalothrin (12.6%+9.5%) ZC at 80 ml, or Neem Oil 1% EC at 200-400 ml per acre.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Yellow Mosaic Virus on Moong?","Final Answer":"Moong (green gram) is a versatile crop and can be grown in two main seasons. Kharif (Monsoon) Season: This is the primary season for mung cultivation. Sowing is done with the onset of the monsoon, typically from June to July. Summer (Zaid) Season: This is a short-duration crop grown after the harvest of Rabi crops like wheat. Sowing is done from February to March. This season often provides a higher yield due to better pest and disease management and controlled irrigation. Mung yellow mosaic is a viral disease caused by the Mung Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV). This is one of the most destructive diseases of mung in India. The virus is not transmitted through seeds or soil; it is spread exclusively by an insect vector: the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). The disease first appears as small, diffused yellow spots on the leaves. These spots gradually expand and merge, leading to a complete yellowing of the leaves. In severe cases, the entire plant turns yellow, with pods remaining small and shriveled, resulting in a significant reduction in yield. The disease is more severe when the weather is warm and dry. Effective control of yellow mosaic requires an integrated approach that combines preventive measures and chemical control of the whitefly vector. Use MYMV-tolerant or resistant varieties such as IPM 205-7 (Virat), IPM 410-3 (Shikha), Pusa Vishal, and Jawahar Moong 721. Sow mung at the recommended time to avoid the peak period of whitefly infestation. Treat seeds with an insecticide like Thiamethoxam 70% WS at 3 grams per kg of seed before sowing. Regularly remove and destroy weeds around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for both the virus and the whiteflies. Or you can give sprays as soon as the first symptoms or whiteflies are observed.

To control them, always use pest-resistant varieties, sow at the recommended time, and avoid late sowing. Place yellow sticky traps (10-12 per acre) in the field to monitor and trap adult whiteflies and aphids. Rotate watermelon with non-cucurbit crops to break the pest cycle. Remove and destroy weed hosts and crop debris. Give a spray of Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40 g per acre (PHI-7 days), or Diafenthiuron 50% WP at 240-250 g per acre (PHI-7 days), or Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 40-60 ml per acre (PHI-7 days). Or Spiromesifen 240 SC at 200 ml per acre (PHI\u20147 days). Or Flonicamid 50% WG at 60 g per acre (PHI- 7 days), or Diamethoate 30% EC at 200-400 ml per acre (PHI- 7 days). Use 200-250 liters of water to ensure proper coverage. Always spray in the morning or evening to avoid evaporation and get better results. Rotate chemicals to prevent the development of resistance. Use appropriate safety gear such as a mask, gloves, goggles, full-sleeve shirts, and boots."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control sucking pest on Cucumber?","Final Answer":"Cucumber is a warm-season crop and is primarily cultivated during two main seasons: Summer Season: The main season for sowing is from February to March. This crop is harvested during the summer months. Kharif (Monsoon) Season: Sowing is done from June to July with the onset of the monsoon. The main sucking pests that attack cucumbers in Madhya Pradesh are aphids, whiteflies, and jassids. They are most active during the early stages of the crop but can persist throughout the season, especially during dry periods. Pests damage the crop by piercing the plant tissue and sucking out the cell sap, which leads to reduced plant vigor, stunted growth, and lower yields. To control them, always use pest-resistant varieties, sow at the recommended time, and avoid late sowing.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What fertilizer can I use for soybean and how much quantity is required?","Final Answer":"The ideal season for soybean cultivation is the kharif season, which is the monsoon season. Sowing typically takes place from mid-June to July, right after the monsoon rains begin, and harvesting is done around October-November. Madhya Pradesh is a leading producer of soybeans in India and is often referred to as the \"Soy State.\" The recommended fertilizer dosage for soybeans can vary based on soil type and specific conditions, but a general recommendation provided by institutions like the Indian Institute of Soybean Research (IISR) is to apply the following nutrients at the time of sowing for one acre: Nitrogen (N): 8.09\u221210.12 kg\/acre, Phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085): 25 kg\/acre, Potash (K\u2082O): 16.19 kg\/acre, Sulfur (S): 8 kg\/acre. To achieve the recommended nutrient grades, you can use a combination of different fertilizers. Approximately 22.66 kg of urea will provide nitrogen. Approximately 156 kg of SSP (Single Super Phosphate) will provide the required phosphorus and sulfur. Approximately 27.11 kg of MOP (Muriate of Potash) will provide the required potash. It is important to note that these are general recommendations. A soil test is the most accurate way to determine the precise fertilizer needs of your specific field. In addition to these macronutrients, soil application of Zinc Sulfate (ZnSO\u2084) at a rate of 10 kg\/acre is also recommended for irrigated conditions."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the varieties of Soybean?","Final Answer":"The ideal season for soybean cultivation is the kharif season, which is the monsoon season. Sowing typically takes place from mid-June to July, right after the monsoon rains begin, and harvesting is done around October-November. Soybean varieties are often recommended based on the agro-climatic zone of the state. Some of the most popular and high-yielding varieties that are widely grown across Madhya Pradesh include NRC 165, JS 22-12, JS 22-16, JS 21-72, RVSM 2011-35, MACS 1520, NRC 150, NRC 152, NRC 138, and NRC 142. The average yield of soybeans can vary significantly depending on the variety, soil type, weather conditions, and farming practices. The average productivity of soybeans is around 4 to 6 quintals per acre (10-15 quintals per hectare). High-yielding varieties: With improved varieties and good management practices, farmers can achieve yields of 10 to 12 quintals per acre (20-30 quintals per hectare) or even higher. Proper spacing is crucial for achieving a good yield. The recommended spacing for soybean cultivation in Madhya Pradesh is row-to-row spacing: 30 to 45 cm (12 to 18 inches). Plant-to-plant spacing: 4 to 7 cm (1.5 to 2.5 inches)"}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Tomato whitefly?","Final Answer":"Whiteflies are tiny, winged insects that are usually found on the underside of tomato leaves. They damage the crop because both the adult and nymph stages of whiteflies feed on the plant's sap. Heavy infestations can weaken the plant, leading to yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, wilting, and premature leaf drop. Whiteflies excrete a sticky, sugary substance called \"honeydew\" on the leaves. This honeydew promotes the growth of a black, sooty mold fungus. The most significant damage caused by whiteflies is their ability to transmit viral diseases, most notably the Tomato Leaf Curl Virus (ToLCV). This virus causes severe stunting, leaf curling, and a drastic reduction or complete loss of yield. To control them, place yellow sticky traps at a rate of 15 per acre throughout the field. Whiteflies are attracted to the yellow color and get stuck, which helps in monitoring and reducing the adult population. Remove and destroy crop residue and weeds, as they can serve as alternative hosts for the pests. When the whitefly population reaches a damaging level, chemical control becomes necessary, such as Neem Oil at 400-600 ml per acre in 200-250 liters of water. Spray Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 60 ml per acre in 150-200 liters of water (PHI-7 days), or Cyantraniliprole 10.26% OD at 360 ml per acre in 200 liters of water (PHI-3 days), or Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40-50 grams per acre in 200 liters of water (PHI-5 days). Always spray in the morning or evening to avoid evaporation and for better results. Rotate chemicals to prevent the development of resistance. Use appropriate safety gear such as a mask, gloves, goggles, full-sleeve shirts, and boots."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the varieties of Papaya?","Final Answer":"Papaya cultivation is best suited for the tropical and subtropical climate of the region. The selection of a papaya variety is crucial for successful cultivation. Farmers widely cultivate both open-pollinated and hybrid varieties, such as Pusa Delicious: this is a gynodioecious variety (producing both hermaphrodite and female plants), ensuring a high percentage of fruit-bearing plants. Pusa Nanha: This is an excellent choice for high-density planting and for farmers with limited land. It is an extremely dwarf variety, making it easy to manage and harvest. Pusa Majesty: A gynodioecious variety with high productivity and good keeping quality, making it suitable for transport. It also has a tolerance to viral diseases and root-knot nematodes. Coorg Honey Dew: A popular variety, also known as 'Madhubindu.' It is known for its greenish-yellow oblong fruits with thick, orange flesh and good flavor. Red Lady (Taiwan 786): This hybrid variety has become extremely popular in Madhya Pradesh, particularly in districts like Barwani. It is a gynodioecious variety known for its high yield, often surpassing traditional varieties. It starts bearing fruit earlier than many other varieties. The fruits have a longer shelf life, which is advantageous for transportation and marketing. It shows good resistance to common diseases, including the devastating Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV). This variety is excellent for table purposes and known for its small fruits with deep pink pulp and a sweet taste. It's often grown in kitchen gardens. Arka Surya: Developed by IIHR, Bangalore, this variety is a cross between Sunrise Solo and is excellent for high-density planting. The yield of papaya depends on the variety, soil fertility, management practices, and climate. For Traditional Varieties: An average yield of 250-300 quintals per acre (20-25 tonnes per acre) is common. High-Yielding Hybrids (e.g., Red Lady): With these improved varieties and high-density planting, the yield can be significantly higher, often reaching 25-30 tonnes per acre. Yield per Plant: A healthy plant can yield anywhere from 40 to 60 kg of fruit in a season. A common spacing is 1.8 m x 1.8 m (6 ft x 6 ft). This spacing accommodates approximately 1,200 plants per acre. For dwarf varieties like Pusa Nanha or hybrids like Red Lady, high-density planting is recommended. Pusa Nanha: 1.2 m x 1.2 m spacing, accommodating around 2,700 plants per acre. Red Lady: 1.5 m x 1.5 m spacing is also common, accommodating a higher number of plants per acre and maximizing yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended varieties of Paddy?","Final Answer":"The ideal season for growing paddy (rice) is the Kharif season. Sowing typically occurs from June to July, with harvesting taking place between October and November. The following are some of the most popular and newly recommended varieties for cultivation. JR 206: Developed by Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (JNKVV), Jabalpur, this variety is a new and promising choice. It's suitable for the entire rice-growing area of the state, with a maturity period of about 120 days. JR 10: Another recommended variety from JNKVV, known for its adaptability to the entire state and a maturity period of around 120 days. It allows farmers to grow a second crop, like lentil or chickpea, after the first crop's harvest. Swarna (MTU 7029): This is a widely popular mega variety known for its stable, high yield, and adaptability. It has excellent resistance to various biotic stresses and is a preferred choice for farmers across different regions. MTU 1010 (Jaya): A high-yielding variety that is very popular in many parts of the country. It is known for its excellent yield potential and wide adaptability. Chinnor: A traditional, aromatic, and high-quality rice variety native to the Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh. It has a Geographical Indication (GI) tag and is highly sought after for its distinct fragrance and softness. JRB-1: This variety has been shown to perform well in irrigated conditions, offering superior yield compared to older, traditional varieties. JR-81: Similar to JRB-1, this variety is also recommended for irrigated areas due to its higher yield potential. The average yield of paddy can vary widely based on the variety, soil type, and management practices. The state's average yield is typically around 12-16 quintals per acre. With improved varieties and better management, farmers can achieve yields of 25-30 quintals per acre. Some of the newly released varieties, like JR 10, have a reported yield potential of 50-55 quintals per hectare, which translates to 20-22 quintals per acre. The ideal spacing for paddy depends on the cultivation method (transplanting or direct seeding) and the variety. Transplanting Method: 20-25 cm x 10-15 cm (Rows x Plants). Plant density: Planting 2-3 seedlings per hill is a common practice to ensure a robust crop stand. Direct Seeding Method: Row-to-row spacing: 20 cm. Standard rates are 15-20 kg\/acre for transplanting and 30-40 kg\/acre for direct seeding."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control damping off in Papaya?","Final Answer":"Damping off is a serious fungal disease that can be devastating to papaya seedlings in the nursery stage. It is caused by soil-borne fungi such as Pythium, Phytophthora, and Rhizoctonia. Papaya is grown in the monsoon season, and the humid and wet conditions are highly favorable for these fungi. The symptoms of damping off are that the seeds rot in the soil before they can even germinate, so the seedlings fail to emerge, or seedlings emerge, but a watery, soft rot appears at the stem base, causing the plant to wither and collapse. The affected area often becomes thin and girdled. To control it, prevention is key, as once a seedling is affected, it is very difficult to save. Use a sterile, well-draining potting mix for your nursery beds or trays. Do not use garden soil, which may be infested with fungi. You can sterilize the soil by solarization or by using a chemical treatment. Thoroughly clean and disinfect all nursery trays, pots, and tools with a 10% bleach solution before use. Avoid overwatering. Or give a seed treatment of Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed, using beneficial microbes such as Pseudomonas fluorescens at 10 grams of Pseudomonas fluorescens per kilogram of seed for seed treatment. Trichoderma viride at 10-15 grams of Trichoderma viride per liter of water, and drench the nursery beds. This can be done as a preventive measure or as soon as the first symptoms are noticed. If preventive measures fail and damping-off appears, immediate chemical intervention is necessary to save the remaining seedlings. A soil drench is a highly effective method to control the fungi in the soil. Mancozeb + Metalaxyl at 2.5 grams per liter of water, or Copper Oxychloride 50% WP at 3 grams per liter of water, or Propamocarb Hydrochloride at 3 ml per liter of water. Always rotate the use of different fungicides to prevent the development of resistance in the fungi."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the seed rate of paddy?","Final Answer":"The ideal season for growing paddy (rice) is the Kharif season. Sowing typically occurs from June to July, with harvesting taking place between October and November. The seed rate of paddy (rice) can vary significantly depending on the method of sowing (transplanting or direct seeding) and the type of variety (hybrid or open-pollinated). Transplanting Method: This is the traditional and most common method of paddy cultivation. In this method, seedlings are first raised in a nursery and then transplanted to the main field. The recommended seed rate for this method is typically 15-20 kg per acre. Direct Seeding Method: This method involves sowing seeds directly in the main field, either by broadcasting or using a seed drill. It is becoming more popular due to its labor-saving benefits and ability to handle weather uncertainty. The seed rate for direct seeding is higher than for transplanting, usually ranging from 30 to 40 kg per acre. Hybrid rice varieties often require a lower seed rate (around 10-15 kg\/acre) compared to open-pollinated varieties, as they have higher germination rates and a better tillering capacity. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control weeds in Soybean?","Final Answer":"Weed control in soybeans is crucial for a good harvest. Weeds compete with the crop for water, nutrients, and sunlight, and if not managed properly, can cause yield losses of up to 80%. An integrated weed management approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods, is the most effective strategy. The first 6 to 7 weeks after sowing are the most critical period for weed competition in soybean. It is essential to keep the field weed-free during this time to prevent significant yield loss. Plowing the field during the summer months helps expose weed seeds and rhizomes to the sun, killing them and reducing the initial weed load. Using traditional tools like a dora or kulpa (a bullock-drawn blade harrow) at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS) and a second time at 40-45 DAS is a highly effective method. This breaks up the soil crust, improves soil aeration, and uproots weeds. If labor is available, one or two rounds of hand weeding, especially within the rows, can be very effective. Hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS is often recommended. Chemical Control (Herbicides): Pre-Emergence Herbicides are applied to the soil after sowing but before the weeds or crop emerge. They create a chemical barrier that kills the weeds as they germinate. Pendimethalin 30% EC at 1.3 liters per acre, or Fluchloralin 45% EC at 1 liter per acre. Post-emergence herbicides are applied after the weeds have emerged. They are generally selective, meaning they target the weeds without harming the soybean crop. Imazethapyr 10% SL at 300 ml per acre (this herbicide controls both broadleaf weeds and grasses), Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC at 300-400 ml per acre (for grassy weeds), or Imazethapyr 35% + Imazamox 35% WG at 40 grams per acre, or Fluazifop-p-butyl 11.1% + Fomesafen 11.1% SL at 1-1.25 liters per acre. Use sufficient water, typically 200-250 liters per acre, to ensure the herbicide reaches all the weeds. Post-emergence herbicides are most effective when the weeds are actively growing, which requires good soil moisture. To prevent herbicide resistance, rotate different classes of herbicides with different modes of action. Use appropriate safety gear such as a mask, gloves, goggles, full-sleeve shirts, and boots."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control yellowness in paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Yellowing in paddy is a common symptom, but the cause can vary; therefore, control depends on proper diagnosis. Nitrogen deficiency causes the uniform yellowing of older leaves. It can be controlled by the application of urea at 35\u201340 kg\/acre (split doses at active tillering and panicle initiation). Iron deficiency, which is common in light soils or after over-irrigation, causes the young leaves to turn yellow and the veins to remain green. To control it, spray 0.5% ferrous sulfate solution (2.5 g\/liter of water) with 0.25% lime (1.25 g\/liter of water), 2\u20133 sprays at 7\u201310 day intervals. Zinc deficiency causes stunted plants with yellowing and brown patches on leaves, and it can be corrected by applying zinc sulfate heptahydrate at 10 kg\/acre or zinc sulfate monohydrate at 7 kg\/acre as a basal soil application at the time of field preparation. For standing crops showing symptoms, a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulfate (2.5 g\/liter of water) along with 1% lime (5 g\/liter of water) should be applied, using about 200 liters of spray solution per acre, repeated after 10\u201315 days if needed. Pests like rice hispa, whorl maggot, and stem borer can also cause yellowing patches. This can be controlled. Use recommended insecticides like Cartap hydrochloride 50 SP 200 g\/acre in 200 liters of water. A pre-harvest interval of 21 days is needed to avoid contamination. Diseases like sheath blight or root rot may also induce yellowing. The control measures are with the fungicide Hexaconazole 5% EC 400 ml\/acre in 200 liters of water, and follow good field sanitation. The pre-harvest interval needed is 21 days to avoid contamination."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the Gridle beetle in Soybean?","Final Answer":"Soybean is cultivated as a Kharif crop, sown with the onset of monsoon in late June to early July and harvested in October\u2013November. One of the serious pests is the girdle beetle (Obereopsis brevis), which causes damage by girdling the petioles and stems, leading to drooping and drying of leaves and branches. To control this pest, farmers should collect and destroy infested twigs and crop residues to reduce carry-over of larvae. Spraying of recommended insecticides such as Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC at 60 ml\/acre or Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC at 160 ml\/acre, or Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 40 g\/acre in 200 L water. The pre-harvest interval needed is 14 days for Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC and Thiamethoxam 25 WG, and 30 days for Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC. Maintaining timely sowing, proper plant spacing, and crop rotation with non-host crops like maize or sorghum also reduces infestation."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control larvae in Soyabean?","Final Answer":"Soybean is not typically grown as a major crop during the Zaid season. Soybean is a major Kharif crop. Identifying the specific larvae and the symptoms they cause is the first step in effective management. In soybeans, the two primary pests are the tobacco caterpillar and the green cloverworm, also known as the green semilooper. The tobacco caterpillar skeletonizes leaves with a mesh-like appearance from initial feeding and later, severe defoliation. The green semilooper causes leaves to have a semi-transparent look, and the caterpillar's unique looping movement is notable. Rotating soybeans with non-host crops can help break the pests' life cycle. Spray Indoxacarb 14.5% SC at 140-160 ml\/acre, known to be very effective against both the tobacco caterpillar and green semilooper. Or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at 60 ml per acre, a highly effective insecticide that provides good control of defoliating caterpillars. The PHI of chlorantraniliprole for soybean is generally 29 days. The PHI of Indoxacarb for soybeans is typically around 18 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control wilt in Arhar(Pigeon pea)?","Final Answer":"No, Arhar is not a typical Zaid season crop. It is a major Kharif season crop. Wilt in arhar (pigeon pea), caused by the fungus, is a serious soil-borne disease that can cause significant yield loss. Recognizing the symptoms is the first step in effective management. The wilt can manifest in two main ways: Sudden wilting (seedling stage): Young plants may suddenly wilt and die without any prior yellowing of the leaves. Gradual Wilting (Later Stages): In older plants, the disease starts with a premature yellowing of the lower leaves. This yellowing progresses upwards, and the leaves eventually wilt and dry up. Varieties like ICPL 88039 (Asha), ICPL 87119 (Maruti), and ICPL 85063 are known to be resistant to wilt. A long-term crop rotation of 3-4 years with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like sorghum or maize) can significantly reduce the pathogen population in the soil. Treat the seeds with a combination of a systemic and a contact fungicide like Carbendazim at 1 gram mixed with Thiram at 2 grams per kg of seed. A safe and effective alternative for seed treatment against wilt is the bio-fungicide Trichoderma viride at 4-5 g\/kg of seed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the Girdle beetle in Soybean?","Final Answer":"Soybean is a major Kharif crop. The girdle beetle is a significant pest of soybeans, especially in central India. It's known for its unique damage pattern, where the adult beetle makes two parallel cuts, or \"girdles,\" on the stem or petiole before laying an egg inside. This damage leads to the wilting and drying of the plant portion above the girdle, which can cause severe yield loss. Plowing the fields deeply during the hot summer months helps to expose and kill the pupae of the girdle beetle, reducing the pest population in the soil for the upcoming season. Sowing the crop at the proper time (usually with the onset of the monsoon) helps the plants establish before the peak activity of the pest. Collect and destroy these parts to get rid of the eggs and developing larvae inside. Spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at 60 ml per acre or Thiamethoxam 12.6% + Lambda-Cyhalothrin 9.5% ZC at 125 ml per acre. The most effective time to spray is when the adult beetles are active, before they lay eggs and the larvae tunnel into the stem. This usually occurs during the early vegetative stage of the crop. The PHI of Chlorantraniliprole is 29 days, and Thiamethoxam + Lambda-Cyhalothrin is 17 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the Blast in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is primarily a Kharif crop. Blast disease in paddy (rice) caused by the fungus is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. It can affect all above-ground parts of the plant and cause significant yield loss. Look for diamond-shaped spots with a gray center on leaves during the tillering stage. The most damaging stage is when the panicle neck turns black, leading to chaffy grains or panicle breakage. High nitrogen levels lead to lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to blast. Maintain a continuous flood of 2-4 inches in the field from the tillering stage until harvest. Remove and destroy infected plant residues and weeds on bunds, as the fungus can survive on them and serve as a source of inoculum. Apply a systemic fungicide like Tricyclazole (150-200 g\/acre) or Carbendazim 50% WP (200 grams per acre). The most effective time to apply fungicides is during the late boot stage and at 50% heading to prevent neck blast, which causes the most yield loss. The PHI for tricyclazole in paddy is generally 40 days, and for carbendazim it is 15 to 20 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Yellow Moisac of Soyabean?","Final Answer":"No, soybean is not typically grown during the Zaid season. Soybean is the most prominent Kharif crop. Yellow mosaic disease (YMD) in soybean is a viral disease caused by the Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV). This disease is a major threat to soybean cultivation and can cause significant yield losses. Since it's a viral disease, there is no direct cure for an infected plant. Therefore, control focuses on a multi-pronged approach of prevention and vector management. The virus is primarily transmitted by the whitefly. The most characteristic symptom is the appearance of bright yellow, patchy, or mosaic-like spots on the leaves, interspersed with green areas. The affected leaves may become crinkled, wrinkled, or puckered. Infected plants often show stunted growth with fewer and smaller pods. Some of the recommended varieties for Madhya Pradesh include JS 20-29, JS 20-69, JS 20-98, and JS 21-75. Treat the seed with Imidacloprid 70% WS or Thiamethoxam 70% WS at a rate of 3-5 grams per kg of seed. If whitefly populations are high or if the disease begins to appear in the field, foliar sprays are necessary. Spray Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 40-50 ml per acre or Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40 grams per acre. Pre-harvest intervals for the foliar sprays are Imidacloprid: 40 days and Thiamethoxam: 14 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the fertilizer dose of Sugarcane?","Final Answer":"For successful sugarcane cultivation, the recommended nutrient requirement per acre is 150 kg of Nitrogen (N), 30 kg of Phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085), and 30 kg of Potassium (K\u2082O). However, to make this recommendation practical for farmers, these nutrient amounts must be converted into actual fertilizer products. To meet the nitrogen requirement, apply approximately 326 kg of urea per acre, which should be split into three equal applications: 109 kg at planting, 109 kg between 45 and 60 days after planting, and 109 kg between 90 and 120 days after planting. This split application supports key growth stages, including early establishment, tillering, and rapid stalk elongation. For phosphorus, apply 188 kg of Single Super Phosphate (SSP) per acre as a basal dose at the time of planting. SSP not only provides phosphorus but also adds calcium and sulfur, which are beneficial to crop growth. For potassium, apply 50 kg of Muriate of Potash (MOP) per acre at planting, supplying the full required dose of potassium for the season."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about the seed treatment of Gram(Chickpea)","Final Answer":"No, chickpea (also known as gram) is not a major crop grown during the Zaid season. Chickpea is a major Rabi crop. The primary goal is to protect the seeds and young seedlings from key soil- and seed-borne diseases such as wilt and dry root rot. It helps protect the seedlings from early-stage insect pests. It promotes uniform germination and vigorous growth of seedlings. It facilitates better nutrient availability, particularly through bio-fertilizers. The recommended fungicides are Carbendazim (50% WP) at a dose of 2 grams per kg of seed or a combination of Carbendazim (1 g\/kg of seed) and Thiram (2 g\/kg of seed). The recommended bio-fertilizers are Rhizobium culture (for nitrogen fixation) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) or Phosphate Solubilizing Fungi (PSF) (for phosphorus availability). Use 100-200 grams of each culture per 10 kg of seed. Insecticide treatment protects the seedlings from pests like termites and cutworms during the early growth stage. Imidacloprid (70% WS) is a common systemic insecticide used for this purpose. The recommended dose is 3-5 grams per kg of seed. Apply the insecticide after the fungicide."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to do seed treatment in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is not grown in the Kharif season ,it is a  major Rabi crop. Seed treatment for wheat is a crucial practice to protect the crop from soil-borne diseases and to ensure a healthy start. The primary goal is to control diseases like Karnal bunt, loose smut, and rusts. For loose smut and flag smut, use carboxin (75% WP) or carboxin 37.5% + thiram 37.5% DS at 2 grams per kg of seed. For Karnal bunt, treat seeds with Tebuconazole 2% DS at 1-1.5 grams per kg of seed. For general protection against root rot and blights, use Carbendazim (50% WP) or Thiram (75% WP) at 2.5 grams per kg of seed. Treat seeds with Azotobacter (for nitrogen fixation) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) at 100-200 grams of each culture per 10 kg of seed. Bio-fertilizers should be applied last, after the chemical fungicides."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control wilt in Lentil?","Final Answer":"No, lentils are not grown in the Kharif season. Lentil (also known as masur) is a major Rabi crop. Young seedlings may suddenly wilt and die, a condition often confused with damping off. Older plants show symptoms more gradually. The leaves turn yellow from the bottom up, and the plant wilts and eventually dries up. A key diagnostic symptom is a dark discoloration of the vascular tissues inside the stem, visible when you split it open. This blocks water and nutrient transport, leading to plant death. For Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, varieties like IPL 316 (L-4076), JLS 1, and JL 3 are recommended. Sowing should be done at the optimum time, as early sowing can increase the incidence of wilt. Use Trichoderma viride or Trichoderma harzianum at a rate of 4 grams per kg of seed. A common recommendation is Carbendazim (50% WP) at a dose of 2 grams per kg of seed. Foliar spray of chemical fungicides is not effective for controlling wilt in lentil once symptoms appear. Chemical control for lentil wilt must be preventative and applied as a seed treatment before sowing. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the varieties of Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is not grown in the Kharif season; it is a major Rabi crop.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Podfly in Arhar(Pigeon pea) crop ?","Final Answer":"Controlling tur podfly in arhar (pigeon pea) requires a combination of cultural and chemical strategies, focusing on protecting the pods during their development. Tur podfly damage is often not visible from the outside in the early stages. The developing maggots bore into and feed on the soft, developing seeds, making them shriveled, striped, and unfit for consumption or germination. As the maggot develops and is ready to pupate, it creates a small pinhead-sized hole in the pod wall to allow the adult fly to emerge. You can also see a dark brown encrustation on the pod surface where the larva has fed. Planting arhar with non-host crops like sorghum or millet can disrupt the pest's life cycle and reduce its incidence. Regularly removing and destroying plant debris and fallen affected pods can reduce breeding grounds for the fly. Chemical control is most effective when targeted at the adult fly before it lays eggs. Sprays should begin at the pod initiation stage. Spray Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC at 250 ml per acre or Dimethoate 30 EC at 300 ml per acre. The first spray should be done at the pod initiation stage, and a second spray can be applied 10 to 12 days later if needed. For Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC, applied at 250 ml per acre, the recommended PHI is 15 days, meaning the crop should not be harvested until at least 15 days after the final spray. For Dimethoate 30 EC, applied at 300 ml per acre, the PHI is 21 days, due to its systemic action and longer persistence in plant tissues."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowing in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is not grown in the Kharif season; it is a major Rabi crop. Control of yellowing in wheat requires identifying the cause, which can be either a nutrient deficiency or a disease. Yellowing in wheat is most commonly due to a lack of nitrogen or sulfur. Nitrogen deficiency: Yellowing of older, lower leaves first. The yellowing spreads upwards to younger leaves as the deficiency becomes more severe. The plant's growth is stunted, and tillering is poor. Apply urea (46% N) as a top dressing. A common recommendation is 30-40 kg of urea per acre. It's best to apply it in two split doses: one at the active tillering stage (20-25 days after sowing) and another at the panicle initiation stage (40-45 days after sowing). Sulfur deficiency: Yellowing of the younger, upper leaves first. The yellowing may spread to the entire plant. Apply gypsum (calcium sulfate) at a rate of 100 kg per acre before sowing. Alternatively, apply ammonium sulfate (24% S) as a source of both nitrogen and sulfur. Yellowing can also be a symptom of a fungal disease, particularly yellow rust. The most characteristic symptom is the appearance of small, yellow-orange pustules arranged in stripes or streaks on the leaves. When you touch an infected leaf, a yellow powder (spores) will rub off on your fingers. Spray Propiconazole 25% EC at 200 ml per acre or Tebuconazole 250 EC at 200 ml per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Sugarcane?","Final Answer":"Effective weed control is critical for a high-yielding sugarcane crop, particularly during the Kharif season when rainfall and high temperatures lead to rapid weed growth. An integrated weed management approach, combining manual, mechanical, and chemical methods, is recommended. The most critical period for weed competition in sugarcane is during the first 90-120 days after planting. Perform manual weeding or hoeing at regular intervals, especially 3-4 weeks after planting, to remove weeds before they establish. Planting short-duration, low-height crops like garlic, onions, or pulses (e.g., moong, urad) between the sugarcane rows. This helps suppress weed growth by competing for sunlight and nutrients. Herbicides are an efficient way to manage weeds, especially in large areas. They should be applied at the correct time and dosage. Atrazine: This is a very common pre-emergence herbicide for sugarcane. A typical dose is around 400-800 g per acre (depending on soil type) mixed with 200-250 liters of water. It should be applied within 3-4 days of planting. For post-emergence control of broadleaf weeds, apply 2,4-D Amine Salt (not the sodium salt) at a dose of 300-500 ml per acre, around 30\u201345 days after planting, when the weeds are still young and actively growing."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the varieties of Arhar (Pigeon pea)?","Final Answer":"Arhar (Pigeon Pea) is a major Kharif crop. There are two main types of arhar (pigeon pea) varieties grown: early-maturing and medium-duration. The choice of variety depends on the local climate, soil type, and farming practices. Early varieties are ideal for regions with a shorter growing season or as a catch crop. They mature in about 120-150 days. ICPL 88039 (Asha): This variety is highly popular and well-suited for the region due to its resistance to wilt and sterility mosaic diseases, which are major threats to arhar cultivation. TJT 501: A high-yielding variety that matures relatively early. It's known for its good grain quality and performance under timely sown conditions. Medium-duration varieties take longer to mature (160-180 days) and are suited for timely sowing and well-irrigated conditions. ICPL 87119 (Asha): This is a widely grown variety in Madhya Pradesh known for its high yield potential and strong resistance to wilt disease. It is a preferred choice for many farmers in the Narsinghpur district. ICPL 85063: This variety is another good option for the region, offering resistance to wilt and sterility mosaic disease.

While some attractions may be affected by heavy rain, the Dhuandhar Falls are at their most spectacular during this time."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Whitefly in Sugarcane?","Final Answer":"Controlling whitefly in sugarcane during the Rabi season requires an integrated approach. A whitefly infestation in sugarcane is a serious issue; the first visible symptom is a widespread yellowing of the leaves, which may later turn a pale or even pinkish-purple color before drying out. The Rabi season for sugarcane planting in this region typically runs from October to November. To control whitefly in sugarcane in Narsinghpur during the Rabi season, regularly remove and burn old, infested lower leaves to reduce the population. Avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, as this can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to whiteflies. Remove and destroy any infested plant residue from previous crops to reduce the initial pest population. If the infestation is severe and other methods are not sufficient, you can use chemical sprays like Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 100-125 ml per acre or Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 40-80 grams per acre. The PHI for imidacloprid on sugarcane is generally 270 days. The PHI for thiamethoxam on various crops can range, but for sugarcane, it is typically 140 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy (rice) is primarily a Kharif crop, meaning it's sown with the onset of the monsoon (June-July) and harvested in the post-monsoon season (October-November). While paddy is not typically a main Zaid crop, a small amount of \"summer paddy\" might be cultivated in some areas with assured irrigation. The typical weed flora in Mandla and surrounding areas includes a mix of grasses, sedges, and broad-leaved weeds. Start with thorough land preparation. Deep summer plowing can expose and kill weed seeds and rhizomes. Puddling and leveling the field before transplanting can significantly reduce weed emergence. Avoid excessive or improper application of nitrogen fertilizer, as it can promote weed growth. Hand weeding is a highly effective method, especially for small fields. Two rounds of weeding are typically required: the first at 15-20 days after transplanting (DAT) and the second at 35-40 days after transplanting. Pre-Emergence Herbicides: These are applied within 1-3 days after transplanting to prevent weed seeds from germinating. A common choice is Pretilachlor 50% EC at a dose of 500-600 ml per acre, mixed with 30-40 kg of sand and broadcast evenly. Early Post-Emergence Herbicides: These are applied 15-25 days after transplanting when weeds are at their 2-4 leaf stage. Bispyribac-sodium 10% SC: An excellent choice for controlling grasses, sedges, and some broad-leaved weeds. The recommended dose is around 80-100 ml per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control of khaira disease in paddy field ?","Final Answer":"Paddy (rice) is not a common Zaid crop. The Kharif season is the main season for paddy cultivation. Khaira disease in paddy is a physiological disorder, not a disease caused by a pathogen. It is a classic symptom of zinc deficiency in the rice plant. Symptoms typically appear within 10-15 days after transplanting. The younger leaves at the base of the plant turn a pale yellowish-green. As the deficiency worsens, small, rusty brown spots appear on the leaves. The plant's growth is severely stunted, and tillering is significantly reduced. The control of Khaira disease is primarily focused on correcting the zinc deficiency in the soil and the plant. The most common and effective method is to apply zinc sulfate heptahydrate at 8-10 kg per acre during the last puddling or final land preparation before transplanting. This provides a slow, steady supply of zinc to the plants. If symptoms appear, spray the crop with a solution of 2 kg of zinc sulfate and 1 kg of slaked lime in 400 liters of water per acre. The first spray should be done as soon as you notice the symptoms. If the symptoms persist after 10-15 days, repeat the spray. Two to three sprays at intervals of 10 days may be required for a full recovery. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Yellow mosaic in Okra?","Final Answer":"Okra Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus (OYVMV) is a major threat to okra cultivation, especially in the Zaid (summer) season, due to high temperatures that favor its vector, the whitefly. The disease itself has no cure, so control strategies focus entirely on managing the whitefly population and preventing the spread of the virus. Many varieties, like Pusa A-4, Arka Anamika, and Parbhani Kranti, have shown good resistance. Regularly scout your field and immediately uproot and burn or bury any plants showing symptoms. Hang yellow sticky traps at a rate of 10-12 traps per acre to monitor and capture adult whiteflies. Some effective insecticides for whitefly control include Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 40-60 ml per acre or Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40 grams per acre. The PHI for imidacloprid on okra is generally 7 days. The PHI for thiamethoxam on okra is generally 5 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control aphids in Paddy?","Final Answer":"The Kharif season is the main season for rice cultivation. Paddy (Rice) is not a primary Zaid crop. Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that feed in clusters on the plant. They suck the sap from the leaves and stems, leading to yellowing of leaves. The plant's vigor is reduced, resulting in stunted growth and a general sickly appearance. Keep the field and its surroundings free of weeds, as they can serve as alternate hosts for aphids. Avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers, which can lead to lush growth that is more susceptible to aphid infestations. Proper drainage and avoiding waterlogging can help maintain plant health and reduce pest pressure. Imidacloprid 17.8% SL can be used at a dose of 40-50 ml\/acre, or Thiamethoxam 25% WG is another effective option at a dose of 40 g\/acre. Ensure thorough spray coverage, focusing on the underside of the leaves, where aphids are typically found. For rice (paddy), the PHI of imidacloprid is generally long, often 40 days. For rice, the PHI for thiamethoxam is typically 21 days."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control insects in Soybean crop?","Final Answer":"No, soybean is a kharif crop. Soybean is attacked by several pests, which can be categorized based on the type of damage they cause. Defoliators: These caterpillars eat the leaves, reducing the plant's ability to photosynthesize. The most common are the tobacco caterpillar and green semilooper. Sucking Pests: These insects suck the sap from the leaves, weakening the plant and transmitting diseases. Major pests include whitefly and jassids. Stem Borers: Pests like the girdle beetle bore into the stem, causing the upper part of the plant to wilt and die. Plant your crop at the recommended time to help it escape the peak population periods of major pests. Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds and crop residue, which can serve as alternate hosts for pests. Use pheromone traps to monitor and trap male moths of defoliators like the tobacco caterpillar at 4-5 traps per acre. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and capture whiteflies and jassids. Chemical control should only be used when the pest population reaches the economic threshold level. For defoliators (caterpillars), use chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at 60 ml\/acre or flubendiamide 39.35% SC at 40 ml\/acre.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control the Gram cutworm?","Final Answer":"Controlling the gram cutworm, a serious pest of Chickpea (Gram), requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach. The pest is particularly damaging at the seedling stage, as the larvae cut young plants at the base and pull them into their burrows to feed. Removing crop residues and weeds from the field and surrounding areas reduces hiding and egg-laying sites for the cutworm moths. Avoiding the consecutive cultivation of susceptible crops like chickpea can break the pest's life cycle. Install light traps (1 trap per acre) at night to attract and kill the adult moths, preventing them from laying eggs. Installing T-shaped perches (20-25 per acre) in the field can encourage predatory birds to perch and feed on the cutworm larvae and other pests. Chemical control is most effective when the infestation is severe and a significant portion of the crop is at risk. Spray Chlorpyriphos 20 EC at 800-1000 ml (use it under the guidance of an expert) or Quinalphos 25 EC at 400-500 ml with sufficient water (typically 200-250 liters for a high-volume sprayer) to get a uniform drench. The PHI for Chlorpyriphos and Quinalphos 25 EC on field crops is commonly cited as 21 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Early Blight in Potato?","Final Answer":"No, potato is not typically grown as a Kharif season crop. Potato is a cool-season crop that is primarily grown during the Rabi season in Madhya Pradesh. Early blight symptoms usually appear on older, lower leaves first. The most characteristic symptom is the development of small, dark brown or black lesions that have a distinct concentric ring pattern. In some cases, the disease can also affect the stems and tubers, causing sunken, dark lesions. Plow the field during the summer to expose fungal spores and debris to the sun's heat, reducing the initial source of infection. Plant only certified, disease-free potato seed tubers to prevent introducing the fungus into the field. Avoid planting potatoes in the same field year after year. Rotate with non-host crops like maize or soybean for at least 2-3 years. Apply a contact fungicide like Mancozeb 75 WP (800-1000 grams per acre) or Chlorothalonil 75 WP (600-800 g per acre) at the first sign of symptoms or when the weather is humid. If the disease is already present, use a systemic fungicide like Azoxystrobin 23% SC at a rate of 200 ml per acre. The PHI for Mancozeb on potatoes is typically 27 days, and Chlorothalonil is generally 7 days. The PHI for azoxystrobin on potatoes is often 14 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Aphids of Lentil?","Final Answer":"No, Lentil (Masoor) is not grown in the Kharif season. Lentil is a Rabi season crop. It requires a cool climate for its vegetative growth and a warm temperature for maturity. In Madhya Pradesh, the sowing of lentils is done during the post-monsoon period, typically from October to November, and the harvesting takes place in the spring. As aphids feed by sucking the sap from the plant, the affected leaves may curl, crinkle, or become distorted. The continuous loss of sap can also cause the leaves to turn yellow and eventually drop off. A heavy aphid population can weaken the plant significantly, leading to stunted growth, reduced branching, and poor pod formation. Sow lentils during the ideal period (mid-October to mid-November) to avoid the peak aphid season. For a non-toxic option, spray neem oil or a neem-based pesticide. It acts as an antifeedant and repellent. For severe infestations, apply systemic insecticides, like Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 50 ml per acre or Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40 grams per acre. The PHI for this systemic insecticide on lentils is generally 21 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to manage yellowing of leaves in wheat?","Final Answer":"Yellowing of wheat leaves can be caused by different factors such as nutrient deficiencies, diseases, pests, or environmental stress. To correct it, first identify the reason nutrient deficiencies like nitrogen or sulfur can be corrected by applying appropriate fertilizers such as urea at 100\u2013120 kg per acre, which must be applied in 2-3 split applications, not all at once. Or gypsum at 100 kg per acre. For sulfur deficiency, ammonium sulfate can be applied at 80\u2013100 kg per acre. If diseases like yellow rust are present, apply fungicides such as propiconazole at 200 ml per acre or tebuconazole at 200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water.

Timely and proper application ensures effective weed control and supports better crop growth."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control rust in wheat?","Final Answer":"Brown rust and yellow rust are serious fungal diseases of wheat. Brown rust favours warm temperatures (15\u201330\u00b0C) and humid conditions, appearing as reddish-brown, oval, or elongated pustules on the leaves. It spreads rapidly when free moisture is available and temperatures are around 20\u00b0C, with new generations of spores forming every 10\u201314 days under favourable conditions. Yellow rust, also known as stripe rust, prefers cooler climates, with temperatures of 8\u201313\u00b0C ideal for spore germination and 12\u201315\u00b0C for further disease development. It forms yellow to orange pustules in narrow stripes along the leaves. Yield losses due to yellow rust can reach up to 30% under high disease pressure. To control brown rust, grow resistant varieties, avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, and spray Propiconazole @ 200 ml\/acre. For yellow rust, grow resistant varieties, rotate crops, and avoid monoculture and overuse of nitrogen. At the early stage of infection, apply sulphur dust @ 5\u201310 kg\/acre, or spray Mancozeb @ 2 g\/litre (\u2248400 g\/acre) or Propiconazole @ 200 ml\/acre. Regular monitoring and timely spraying are essential for managing both diseases effectively."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"When to do 1st irrigation, 2nd irrigation in wheat?","Final Answer":"The wheat crop requires timely irrigation for optimal growth and yield. Depending on soil type and rainfall, the crop generally needs 4 to 6 irrigations, but at least 5 are considered essential at critical growth stages. The first irrigation should be given immediately after sowing to ensure proper germination, but care must be taken to avoid water stagnation at this stage. The second irrigation is done at the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage, around 21 days after sowing (DAS), which is one of the most critical stages for crop establishment and tillering. Subsequent irrigations should be scheduled at the active tillering stage (35\u201340 DAS), flowering stage (50\u201355 DAS), and grain filling stage (70\u201375 DAS). Among these, the CRI and flowering stages are the most sensitive to water stress and must be prioritized to avoid yield loss."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Leaf borer in Rice crop?","Final Answer":"Leaf folder is a common pest in rice, especially under conditions of high humidity and heavy fertilization.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which fungicide can be use for the seed treatment of Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a rabi season crop, and seed treatment with fungicides is essential to protect against seed-borne and early-season soil-borne diseases such as loose smut, bunt, root rot, and seedling blight. Seed treatment involves applying fungicides and\/or insecticides to the seeds before planting. The fungicides are absorbed by the seed, protecting the developing seedling from pathogens during germination and early growth. This protection reduces early-season stress, improves root establishment, enhances plant vigour, and ultimately leads to better yields. Recommended fungicides for seed treatment: Carbendazim 50% WP: 2 g\/kg seed \u2013 controls loose smut, bunt, seed rot, Thiram 75% WP: 3 g\/kg seed \u2013 controls seed rot, damping-off. Tebuconazole 2% DS: 1.25 g\/kg seed \u2013 effective against loose smut and other seed-borne diseases. Use certified, disease-free seed. Use a clean, dry container for mixing seeds and fungicide. Mix the recommended dose thoroughly to ensure uniform coating. Dry the treated seed in shade for about 30 minutes before sowing. For added protection, combine fungicide treatment with a bio-agent such as Trichoderma viride @ 4 g\/kg seed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended fertilizer dose for Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is grown during the rabi season because it requires cool temperatures (10\u201325\u00b0C) and dry weather for proper growth and grain filling. In the kharif season, high heat and heavy rains damage the crop, so wheat does not grow well. Recommended fertilizer doses: Rainfed crop: 35 kg urea + 50 kg SSP per acre, Semi-irrigated crop: 52 kg urea + 75 kg SSP + 10 kg MOP per acre, Irrigated crop: 104 kg urea + 150 kg SSP + 20 kg MOP per acre, Late-sown crop: 70 kg urea + 100 kg SSP + 13 kg MOP per acre. For irrigated conditions, the full doses of SSP (phosphorus) and MOP (potassium), along with half the recommended dose of urea (nitrogen), should be applied as a basal dressing at the time of sowing. The remaining half of the urea should be top-dressed at the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage, which occurs about 20\u201325 days after sowing, ideally just before or after the first irrigation. In rainfed or non-irrigated conditions, the entire quantity of urea, SSP, and MOP should be applied at the time of sowing. Farmers are also advised to conduct soil testing to determine precise nutrient requirements, as these recommendations are general and based on average soil fertility."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the suitable varieties of Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is mainly grown in the Kharif season and not in the Zaid season because it is a water-loving crop that needs heavy rainfall and standing water for proper growth. During Kharif (June-October), the monsoon rains provide abundant water, and the temperature (25\u201335\u00b0C) with high humidity creates a suitable environment for seed germination, tillering, and grain filling. In contrast, the Zaid season (March\u2013June) is hot and dry with very limited water availability, making it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. The major rice varieties grown are Jeeraphool, known for its aromatic quality, produces around 12-13 quintals per acre; Chinnor, another famous traditional variety, yields about 8\u201310 quintals per acre, which is lower but valued for its unique taste and fragrance; Pragati and Jagrati, both modern high-yield lines, commonly yield up to 22 quintals per acre with optimal management; Pusa Sugandha 3 and Pusa Sugandha 4 yield about 15-16 quintals per acre and are appreciated for their superior scent; Sahyadri and MTU 1010 typically produce around 14-15 quintals per acre; Mahamaya, HMT, and CR Dhan 802 (Subhas) show similar performance with yields ranging from 12\u201316 quintals per acre under good irrigation and agronomic care; and hybrid varieties like JRH-5 and JRH-19 can reach yields of 17-18 quintals per acre, outperforming local traditional lines in suitable conditions. Selecting the right variety in line with soil type, water availability, and market preference is essential for maximizing yield and profit in the state."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Blast in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the Kharif season (June\u2013October) because it is a water-loving crop that needs heavy rainfall, high humidity, and warm temperatures (25\u201335\u00b0C) for proper growth. In the Zaid season (March\u2013June), the weather is hot and dry with limited water availability, which makes it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. Blast in paddy causes leaf spots and neck\/panicle infection, leading to drying and yield loss, especially under high humidity and excess nitrogen. To manage blast disease in paddy, grow blast-resistant varieties suitable for the state, such as IR-64, IR-36, Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa Sugandha-5, Pusa Sugandha-4, MTU-1010, and NDR-97, which give better protection against the disease. Always use balanced fertilizers, apply nitrogen in split doses and add potash to strengthen plants. Maintain proper spacing for better air circulation and avoid excess humidity in the field. Regularly monitor fields from nursery to panicle initiation stage, as blast is most severe during this period. If symptoms appear, spray Isoprothiolane 40 EC at 300 ml\/acre or Hexaconazole 5 EC at 400 ml\/acre in 200 litres of water, repeating after 10\u201312 days if required. Avoid over-irrigation and destroy diseased residues after harvest to break the cycle. Always maintain a Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 30 days for Isoprothiolane and 20 days for Hexaconazole. Always spray only when needed and avoid applications close to harvest to ensure safe grain quality."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Aphids in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the Kharif season (June\u2013October) because it is a water-loving crop that needs heavy rainfall, high humidity, and warm temperatures (25\u201335\u00b0C) for proper growth. In the Zaid season (March\u2013June), the weather is hot and dry with limited water availability, which makes it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. Aphids in paddy suck plant sap, weaken the crop, and transmit viruses, leading to poor growth and reduced yield. Install yellow sticky traps at a rate of 6\u20138 per acre to monitor and trap adult aphids. Always avoid excess nitrogen, keep proper plant spacing, and encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and spiders. Regular field monitoring is important, especially at the tillering and booting stages. If infestation crosses the ETL (10\u201315 aphids per tiller), use need-based sprays (Neem oil 10,000 ppm 3-5 ml\/litre or 1 litre\/acre). For severe outbreaks, use recommended insecticides such as Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 40 g\/acre, Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 60-80 ml\/acre, or Acetamiprid 20 SP at 40 g\/acre in 150\u2013200 litres of water, ensuring rotation of chemicals to prevent resistance. Sprays should be directed to the underside of leaves where these pests normally settle. Maintain a pre-harvest interval of 21 days for Thiamethoxam, 15 days for Acetamiprid 20 SP, and 40 days for Imidacloprid. Always spray only after crossing ETL and avoid applications near harvest for safe produce."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Gandhi bug in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the Kharif season (June\u2013October) because it is a water-loving crop that needs heavy rainfall, high humidity, and warm temperatures (25\u201335\u00b0C) for proper growth. In the Zaid season (March\u2013June), the weather is hot and dry with limited water availability, which makes it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. Gandhi bug (also called rice earhead bug) is a major pest of paddy that sucks sap from developing grains, causing chaffy and discolored grains. To control it, keep the field clean by removing grassy weeds and stubble, and encourage natural enemies like spiders and mirid bugs. Light traps can also be used during evening hours to catch adults. For chemical control, spray Dinotefuran 15 + Pymetrozine 45 WG at 133 g\/acre or Imidacloprid 6 + Lambda-cyhalothrin 4 SL at 120 ml\/acre. Always maintain a Pre-harvest interval of 7 days for Dinotefuran 15 + Pymetrozine 45 WG and 15 days for Imidacloprid 6 + Lambda-cyhalothrin 4 SL.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the best time of sowing wheat crop?","Final Answer":"The optimal timing for sowing wheat is crucial for achieving high yields. It depends on the type of wheat variety and the local climatic conditions. In the central and Dewas\u2013Malwa plateau regions, the ideal time for sowing is from the last week of October to the second week of November, which is particularly important for timely-sown conditions. For late-sown conditions in the same regions, the sowing window extends from the third week of November to the first week of December, especially when the preceding crop, such as soybean, is harvested late. In the Vindhyan plateau region, the recommended sowing time is slightly later, from the first week to the third week of November. The core principle is to sow wheat when the temperature begins to drop after the monsoon heat. The ideal temperature range for sowing is 20\u201325\u00b0C, which ensures proper germination and seedling growth. The choice of variety should be aligned with the sowing time. Long-duration varieties are best for timely sowing (late October to mid-November), while short-duration and heat-tolerant varieties are more suitable for late sowing (December). It is always advisable to consult the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or District Agriculture Office for the most precise sowing recommendations tailored to your specific district and the prevailing seasonal weather conditions."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Termites in Wheat Crop?","Final Answer":"Termites are a significant pest of wheat; they can cause severe damage from the sowing stage up to maturity by feeding on the roots and base of the stem, leading to reduced plant stand and the condition known as \u201cwhite ears.\u201d Termites can also damage sown seeds, resulting in poor germination and a lower plant stand. Affected young plants show wilting and yellowing, while in mature plants, the most characteristic symptom is dry, white earheads containing no grains. This occurs because termites feed at the base of the stalk, cutting off nutrient supply to the ear. The white ears can be easily pulled out of the ground. A combination of preventive and chemical measures is the most effective way to manage termites in wheat: Preventive measures Deep ploughing during summer: Exposes termite colonies and queens to the sun and predatory birds, reducing the initial population. Use well-decomposed FYM: Fresh or improperly decomposed manure can attract termites. Maintain soil moisture: Termites prefer dry soil. Keeping the field adequately moist during early stages helps reduce termite activity. Chemical and biological control: Seed treatment: Imidacloprid 70% WS @ 3\u20135 g\/kg of seed, Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 2\u20133 g\/kg of seed Mix the required amount of powder with a small amount of water to make a slurry, then coat the seeds evenly before sowing. This protects the crop for 30\u201345 days. Broadcast application: Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 5\u201310 kg\/acre, Biopesticide: Metarhizium anisopliae: 2\u20134 kg\/acre (powder) or 1\u20132 liters\/acre (liquid). This fungus infects and kills termites upon contact. Important: To prevent insecticide resistance, do not use the same class of chemical repeatedly."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What fertilizers should I use for wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat cultivation requires a balanced application of NPK fertilizers for optimal yield. The exact quantities depend on whether they are applied as a basal dose (at sowing) or as a top-dressing. Soil testing should be done to determine the nutrient status, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Most districts in the state also show micronutrient deficiencies. Apply zinc sulphate @ 10 kg\/acre once every three crops (not every year). Recommended nutrient doses (per acre): Nitrogen: 40\u201348 kg, Phosphorus: 24\u201328 kg, Potassium: 12\u201316 kg. These requirements can be met using a combination of different fertilizers. Fertilizer application is typically done in two stages: a basal dose at the time of sowing and one or two top-dressings. Basal dose (at sowing): Apply DAP @ 53\u201361 kg\/acre and MOP @ 20\u201326 kg\/acre using a seed-cum-fertilizer drill, ensuring placement at 5\u20136 cm below the seed.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Stem borer in Paddy?","Final Answer":"The paddy stem borer is a major pest, causing a characteristic \"Dead Heart\" in young plants and \"White Ears\" in mature plants. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach is the most effective way to control this pest. Granular insecticides are a very common and effective way to control stem borers, as they protect the plants for a long period. These are typically applied in the field water, such as Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg per acre (PHI-32 days), apply as a broadcast application in the field 25-30 days after transplanting (DAT). Ensure the field has standing water at the time of application, or Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR @ 4 kg per acre (PHI-53-65 days). Or you can use foliar sprays, which are used when the infestation is noticed or at the tillering stage. They provide a quicker knockdown effect than granular products such as Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre (PHI-47 days), or Flubendiamide 39.35% SC @ 60-70 ml per acre (PHI-40 days), or Cartap Hydrochloride 50% SP @ 400-600 grams per acre (PHI-21 days), or Acephate 75% SP @ 400-500 grams per acre (PHI-14 days). For granular insecticides, maintaining a 2-3 cm standing water level in the field for a few days after application is crucial for the granules to dissolve and be absorbed by the plants. To prevent resistance, do not use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different classes of insecticides. The ideal time for the first application is at the early tillering stage (20-30 DAT). A second application may be needed at the panicle initiation stage."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Blast disease in Rice?","Final Answer":"Blast disease affects rice crops at all growth stages, from seedling to panicle formation. Symptoms appear on leaves, nodes, panicles, and glumes. On leaves, small bluish-green flecks develop into characteristic spindle-shaped spots with grey centers and dark brown margins, known as leaf blast. These spots may coalesce under humid conditions, causing large areas of leaf tissue to die, giving the field a burnt appearance. Nodal blast appears as black lesions around the nodes, often leading to stem breakage and death of the upper parts of the plant. Internodal infection can result in white, empty panicles, which may resemble yellow stem borer or drought damage. Neck blast produces grayish-brown lesions around the neck of the panicle, frequently causing breakage or poor grain development, especially if infection occurs before the milky stage. Lesions can also appear on panicle branches and spikelets. Effective management includes the use of resistant varieties, seed treatment with Thiram at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed, and good agronomic practices such as proper plant spacing, avoiding excessive nitrogen application, ensuring good drainage, and removing infected crop residues. At the first sign of symptoms, apply fungicides such as Isoprothiolane 40% EC at 300 ml\/acre or Azoxystrobin 23% SC at 200 ml\/acre, diluted in 200 liters of water per acre. If the disease persists, repeat applications every 10\u201312 days. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) is 60 days for isoprothiolane and 21 days for azoxystrobin. Following these integrated management strategies helps minimize disease spread and protect crop yield."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the split doses of Urea in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is grown in the Rabi season because it needs cool temperatures (10\u201325\u00b0C) and dry weather for proper growth and grain filling. In the Kharif season, high heat and heavy rains damage the crop, so wheat cannot grow well. For a rainfed crop, apply 35 kg of urea per acre. For semi-irrigated, apply 52 kg urea per acre. For irrigated crops, apply 104 kg urea per acre. For late-sown, apply 70 kg of urea per acre. For irrigated conditions, half of the recommended dose of urea (nitrogen) should be applied as a basal dressing at the time of sowing. The remaining half of the urea should be top-dressed during the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage, which occurs approximately 20-25 days after sowing, ideally just before or after the first irrigation. In contrast, for rainfed or non-irrigated conditions, the entire quantity of urea should be applied at the time of sowing. Farmers are also advised to conduct soil testing to determine precise nutrient requirements, as these are general recommendations for areas with average soil fertility."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Khaira disease in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is mainly grown in the Kharif season and not in the Zaid season because it is a water-loving crop that needs heavy rainfall and standing water for proper growth. During Kharif (June\u2013October), the monsoon rains provide abundant water, and the temperature (25-35\u00b0C) with high humidity creates a suitable environment for seed germination, tillering, and grain filling. In contrast, the Zaid season (March\u2013June) is hot and dry with very limited water availability, making it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. Zinc deficiency in paddy causes khaira disease, leading to yellowing and bronzing of leaves with brown spots. To avoid this deficiency, apply 10 kg Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) per acre of area before transplanting or sowing of paddy. If the zinc deficiency occurs in your standing crop, then spray 5 grams of Zinc Sulphate + 2.5 grams of unslaked lime per litre of water."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Stem borer in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Yellow stem borer in paddy damages the crop by boring into the stem, causing dead hearts in the vegetative stage and white ears in the grain stage. To manage it, practice timely sowing, do mass trapping of yellow stem borer male moths by installing pheromone traps at 8 traps\/acre with lures containing 5 mg pheromone at 20 days after transplanting. A Chinsurah light trap or any other light trap can be operated for two hours in the evening to observe phototrophic insect pests. Do clipping of rice seedlings at the time of transplanting to minimize carryover of rice hispa, case worm, and stem borer infestation from seedbed to the transplanted fields. Egg parasitoids Trichogramma japonicum and T. chilonis can be released at 40,000\/acre on the appearance of egg masses\/moth of the yellow stem borer in the field. If the pest crosses the ETL (Economic Threshold Level): 10% dead hearts in the vegetative stage or 2 egg masses\/sq. m. Then apply insecticides like cartap hydrochloride 4% granules at 7.5 kg\/acre or cartap hydrochloride 50% SP at 400 g\/acre. Always apply these insecticides when the soil has sufficient moisture, or do light irrigation after broadcasting them. Always follow product label guidelines for application and 21-day Pre-Harvesting Interval (PHI) for Cartap hydrochloride."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Blast disease in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is mainly grown in the Kharif season and not in the Zaid season because it is a water-loving crop that needs heavy rainfall and standing water for proper growth. During Kharif (June\u2013October), the monsoon rains provide abundant water, and the temperature (25\u201335\u00b0C) with high humidity creates a suitable environment for seed germination, tillering, and grain filling. In contrast, the Zaid season (March\u2013June) is hot and dry with very limited water availability, making it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. Blast disease in paddy causes spindle-shaped brown lesions on leaves, neck rot, and poor grain filling, leading to heavy yield loss. To manage it, use blast-resistant,\/tolerant varieties. Always do seed treatment before sowing. Apply a talc-based formulation of Pseudomonas fluorescens as a seed treatment at 10 g per kg of seed and for seedlings, dip the roots for 30 minutes in a solution containing P. fluorescens (2.5 kg of formulation mixed with 2.5 cm of water in a 25 m\u00b2 nursery area).

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Blast disease in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Blast disease affects rice crops at all growth stages, from seedling to panicle formation. Symptoms appear on leaves, nodes, panicles, and glumes. Leaf blast: Small bluish-green flecks develop into characteristic spindle-shaped spots with grey centers and dark brown margins. These spots can merge under humid conditions, causing large portions of the leaf to dry and die, giving the field a burnt appearance. Nodal blast: Black lesions girdle the nodes, leading to stem breakage and death of the upper plant parts. Internodal infection: Can cause white, empty panicles, mimicking yellow stem borer damage or drought stress. Neck blast: Grayish-brown lesions form around the neck of the panicle, often leading to breakage or poor grain development, especially if infection occurs before the milky stage. Lesions may also form on panicle branches and spikelets. Effective management includes: Resistant varieties suitable for your region. Seed treatment with Thiram 42-S \u2013 2\u20133 g per kg of seed. Good agronomic practices: proper spacing, avoiding excess nitrogen, ensuring good drainage, and removing infected crop residues.

These integrated approaches help reduce disease spread and safeguard yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the late sown varieties of wheat in Madhya Pradesh?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a Rabi season crop, and there are late-sown wheat varieties suitable. Major constraints in production are poor varietal replacement, heat and drought stress and late sowing. Irrigated late sown (sowing from 1 December to 5 January) - HI 1634 (Pusa Ahilya)- 110-115 days to mature, average yield - 16-18 quintals per acre. Seed, rate - 40 kg per acre. HI 1633 (Pusa Vani)- 110-115 days to mature, average yield - 15-16 quintals per acre and performs well in late sowing after pulses or paddy due to its shorter duration. Seed rate- 25%-50 kg per acre. Sowing wheat later than the optimal window can lead to reduced tillering and lower yields due to heat stress during grain filling. These varieties, however, are bred for shorter growing periods, disease resistance, and adaptability to delayed planting schedules."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much of urea is required for Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"For optimal crop growth and yield, it is recommended to apply fertilizers in the following quantities per acre: Urea: 110 kg, applied in 2\u20133 doses \u2013 first after the first irrigation and second at the second irrigation. DAP: 55 kg or SSP: 155 kg, MOP: 20 kg. This balanced nutrient application ensures proper plant development by supplying essential macro- and micronutrients required throughout the crop cycle."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Weeds in wheat can reduce yields by 25 to 35 percent,  depending on their density and competition for nutrients, water, light, and space. The major weeds in wheat are classified into two groups: broadleaf weeds such as Bathua, Senji, Dudhi, Chicory, Wild Spinach, Akri, Wild peas, Krishnanil, Satyanashi, and Hirankhuri; and narrowleaf weeds including Motha, Kans, Wild Oats, Chiraiya, Millet, and various grasses. Effective weed management is essential to minimize yield loss. Chemical weed control is preferred because it requires less labor and avoids the mechanical damage associated with manual weeding. For pre-emergence control, apply Pendimethalin (Stomp 30 EC) @ 1 litre per acre in 200 litres of water, ideally 0 to 3 days after sowing or before sowing. This controls both broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds at the early stage. For post-emergence control, use 2,4-D @ 250 ml per acre in 150 litres of water to target broadleaf weeds effectively."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the seed rate of wheat crop?","Final Answer":"For successful crop establishment standard seed rate is 40 kg\/acre for timely sown wheat and is increased to 50 kg\/acre for late-sown wheat to compensate for reduced tillering. Ensure that the seed is properly cleaned and graded before sowing to remove impurities and underdeveloped grains. Before sowing, it is essential to treat the seeds with a suitable fungicide to protect against seed- and soil-borne diseases. Use any one of the following fungicides at the recommended dose of 2 grams per kg of seed: Raxil, Thiram, Vitavax, or Tebuconazole. Proper seed treatment enhances germination, reduces disease risk, and promotes healthy early plant growth."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended fertilizer for wheat cultivation?","Final Answer":"Wheat is not grown in the Kharif season, but rather as a Rabi crop(winter season). According to the Directorate of Wheat Development and other agricultural research, the recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) for irrigated and timely-sown wheat in the Central Zone is: Nitrogen (N): 50 kg per acre, Phosphorus (P): 25 kg per acre, Potash (K): 16 kg per acre. Apply half of the recommended nitrogen and all of the phosphorus and potash at the time of sowing. The remaining half of nitrogen should be applied as a top dressing at the first node stage, which is typically 35\u201340 days after sowing. Applying 4\u20136 tons of Farmyard manure (FYM) per acre before sowing is recommended to improve soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability. A general recommendation is to apply 10 kg of zinc sulfate per acre once a year, at the time of sowing."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Rice fIeld?","Final Answer":"The primary season for paddy (rice) cultivation is the Kharif season, which relies on the monsoon rains. Controlling weeds in rice fields requires a combination of integrated methods, including cultural, mechanical, and chemical approaches, to be most effective. Thorough summer plowing exposes and kills weed seeds and underground plant parts by desiccation. In transplanted rice, maintaining a 2-3 cm layer of standing water in the field after transplanting helps to suppress the germination and growth of most weeds. Hand weeding is a very effective method, especially for small-scale farming. It is recommended to perform weeding at least twice, typically around 20 and 45 days after transplanting. Pre-Emergence Herbicides: These are applied right after transplanting before weeds emerge. They prevent the first flush of weed growth. Pretilachlor is a widely used pre-emergence herbicide that is effective against grasses, sedges, and broadleaf weeds. The recommended dosage is typically 600-750 ml per acre. Post-Emergence Herbicides: These are applied after weeds have emerged and are at the 2-5 leaf stage. They are often weed-specific. Bispyribac Sodium (10% SC) is a very effective, broad-spectrum herbicide that controls grasses, sedges, and broadleaf weeds. It's often used at a low dosage of 80-120 ml per acre and is safe for the rice crop. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What seed treatment can I do for paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Seed treatment is a crucial and non-negotiable step for paddy (rice) cultivation. It is the most effective and economical way to protect seeds and seedlings from soil-borne diseases and to promote vigorous early growth. A comprehensive seed treatment for paddy should involve a combination of fungicides, insecticides (if needed for soil pests), and bio-fertilizers. Fungicidal Seed Treatment: Treat seeds with Carbendazim + mancozeb at 2 grams per kilogram of seeds. Insecticidal Seed Treatment: Thiamethoxam 70% WS @ 1 gram per kg of seed, or Chlorpyrifos 20% EC @ 3 ml per kg of seed. Bio-fertilizer Seed Treatment: Azospirillum (for nitrogen fixation) and Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) @ 200 grams of Azospirillum and 200 grams of PSB for enough seeds to cover one acre. This is approximately 10 grams per kg of seed. The order of application is critical to ensure that the fungicides and insecticides do not harm the beneficial bacteria in the bio-fertilizers. Fungicide: Apply the fungicide first. Insecticide (if needed): Apply the insecticide next. Bio-fertilizer: Apply the bio-fertilizers last, just before sowing. By following this comprehensive seed treatment protocol, you can ensure a healthy plant stand, protect your crop from early-season threats, and set the stage for a high yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Weeds in Paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"Controlling weeds in paddy cultivation is very important for achieving higher yields, as weeds compete with the crop for nutrients, water, and sunlight. The major weeds seen in paddy fields include grassy weeds such as Echinochloa colona (jungle rice) and Dinebra retroflexa, sedges such as Cyperus iria (motha or rice flat sedge), and broadleaf weeds like Commelina benghalensis and Alternanthera sessilis, which are serious problems during the rainy season rice crop. To manage weeds in paddy fields, an integrated weed management (IWM) approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical measures is recommended. Maintain shallow standing water (2\u20135 cm) after transplanting to suppress most grassy and broadleaf weeds naturally, and always use certified, disease-free seeds. Carry out hand weeding at 15\u201320 days after transplanting (DAT) and again at 35\u201340 DAT. This is very effective but labour-intensive. Use tools such as a cono weeder or rotary weeder in transplanted paddy for effective control of weeds in the early stages. Plough the field with a rotavator or cultivator to achieve fine tilth, remove weeds and stubble, and ensure proper leveling for uniform germination and crop stand. In heavily weed-infested areas, follow the stale seedbed technique. In this method, allow weeds to germinate before sowing, then kill them with shallow tillage or by spraying a non-selective herbicide such as glyphosate or paraquat at least 10 days before sowing. This method greatly reduces weed pressure in DSR. Cultural and mechanical methods alone are often insufficient, so use chemical herbicides for effective weed control. Spray pre-emergence herbicides(within 2-3 days of sowing(DSR rice)\/transplanting) such as Pretilachlor 50 EC @ 600 ml in 200 litres of water per acre or Butachlor 50 EC 1200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water on standing water for controlling grassy weeds and Echinochloa Chlona (jungle rice). For post emergence control, apply post herbicides herbicides such as Bispyribac Sodium 10 SC @ 80-100 ml per acre in 200 litres of water after 15-20 days of sowing(DSR rice)\/transplanting when weed plants are at 2-4 leaf stage or Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9EC @ 250 ml per acre in 200 litres of water or Metsulfuron-methyl 10%+ Chlorimuron-ethyl 10% WP @ 8 gram per acre in 200 litres of water at 20-25 days after planting for controlling grassy weeds and broadleaf weeds. Rotate herbicides to prevent resistance and always check the product label for the proper PHI(pre-harvest interval) period or days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to increase production of Paddy?","Final Answer":"To increase rice production, select high-yielding and region-specific varieties such as IR-64, MTU-1010, JRH-5, and hybrid varieties recommended by local agriculture universities. Prepare the field with fine tilth, proper leveling, and bunding to ensure uniform water distribution. Employ alternate wetting and drying or System of Rice Intensification (SRI) methods to save water and improve root growth. In water-stress areas, choose the DSR method instead of traditional transplanting. It saves labor, reduces water requirements, and can be more cost-effective.  Recommended early-maturing varieties include JRH-5, JRH-8, PS-6129, Danteswari, and Sahabhagi. For medium-maturing varieties, use WGL-32100, Pusa Sugandha-3, Pusa Sugandha-5, MTU-1010, and JR-353. Avoid growing Revolution and Mahamaya varieties. Follow soil test-based nutrient management to apply optimal quantities of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients like zinc and iron. Integrated nutrient management combining organic manures and chemical fertilizers improves soil health and productivity. For maximum benefit from Basmati, prefer Pusa Basmati-1121, Pusa Basmati-1509, and Pusa Basmati-1460 on larger areas. Sow in rows, maintaining a spacing of 15 \u00d7 15 cm for very early and early-maturing varieties, 20 \u00d7 15 cm for medium-maturing varieties, and 25 \u00d7 20 cm for late-maturing varieties. Apply 6-7 kg blue blue-green algae at 20 days after sowing or transplanting because it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. It also improves soil fertility and promotes healthy crop growth. Monitor pest populations such as stem borers, leaf folders, and diseases like blast and bacterial blight. Implement integrated pest management with biological controls and judicious insecticide use. Timely application of herbicides like Pretilachlor or Pendimethalin in early crop stages, combined with manual weeding or mechanical weeders, reduces yield losses caused by weeds."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control stem borer in rice?","Final Answer":"Stem borer is one of the most destructive pests of paddy (rice), causing significant yield losses if not managed effectively. Stem borer bores into the stem and causes damage mainly from July to October. In the vegetative stage, the central shoot dies and turns yellow, a symptom known as dead heart, and in the ear-bearing stage, the ear head becomes completely chaffy and white, causing white ear head. Both the dead heart and the white ear head can be easily pulled out, and the base of the plant shows clear signs of feeding injury. To control yellow stem borer in paddy, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended. Regularly scout the field around 20-40 days after transplanting for egg masses and early larval damage, maintain proper spacing, avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertilizer, remove and destroy stubble and weed hosts, and avoid late planting. Maintain optimal water level, clip the tip of the seedlings before transplanting to eliminate egg mass, encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predators, install pheromone traps @ 5-6 per acre for timely monitoring, and spray neem-based pesticide Ecotin(azadirachtin 5% ) @ 80 ml in 100 litres of water at the early stage. If the field shows more than 10% dead heart at the vegetative stage or 2% White ear at the Flowering stage, insecticide application is recommended. The recommended insecticides for controlling stem borer in paddy are: Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 60 ml per acre in 150-200 litres of water(PHI 47 days) or Flubendiamide 39.35% SC @ 20 ml in 150-200 litres of water(PHI 40 days) or Flubendiamide 20 WG @ 80 grams per acre in 150-200 litres of water(PHI 30 days). Rotate Chlorantraniliprole with Flubendiamide to prevent resistance. Always spray during early morning and late afternoon."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which wheat varieties are suitable for late sowing in Madhya Pradesh?","Final Answer":"Late sowing of wheat should generally be avoided, and timely sowing is preferred because water shortage during the ripening stage can severely affect yield. Irrigation at this stage is essential for proper grain filling. Certain varieties that are more tolerant to late sowing include JW 1202, HD 2404, MP 1202, and HI 1454. For timely sowing, suitable varieties are JW 1142, JW 1201, GW 366, and HI 1418, which perform well under irrigated conditions in this region. For rainfed or semi-irrigated conditions, varieties like JW 3020, JW 3173, and HI 1500 are recommended."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control aphids in paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"Aphids can cause damage in paddy, but they are not considered a major pest. Their impact is minor compared to destructive pests like stem borers and planthoppers. Aphids are small sap-sucking insects that feed on the phloem of rice plants. In high populations, they can stunt plant growth, reduce tillering, and affect grain filling. However, controlling aphids is usually not a major concern unless their population explodes. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is best: avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer, and rely on natural predators such as lady beetles, lacewings, and spiders, which help keep aphid numbers in check. If aphids become a serious problem, apply insecticides such as Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water, or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 g per acre in 200 litres of water. Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance. Maintain 40-day PHI(Pre-Harvest Interval) periods for Imidacloprid 17.8 SL, and 21 days for Thiamethoxam 25 WG."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended irrigation schedule for wheat cultivation?","Final Answer":"Wheat crops generally require 4\u20136 irrigations, depending on soil type, weather, and rainfall. First irrigation: Apply at the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage, 20\u201325 days after sowing. This is the most critical stage. Lack of water can cause poor root growth and significantly reduce yield. The first irrigation should be light to avoid damaging the roots. Second irrigation: Apply during the tillering stage, around 35\u201340 days after sowing. Irrigation at this stage promotes a higher number of productive tillers. Third irrigation: Apply at 60\u201365 days after sowing during the late jointing stage. Water at this stage is essential for stem development and nutrient uptake. Fourth irrigation: Apply at 85\u201390 days after sowing during flowering. Water stress during this stage can lead to poor pollination and fewer grains per ear. Fifth irrigation: Apply at 105\u2013110 days after sowing during the milk stage. Adequate irrigation ensures proper grain size and weight. Sixth irrigation (if available): Apply at 130\u2013135 days after sowing during the dough stage. If only 3 irrigations are available: Apply at the most critical stages \u2014 CRI (20\u201325 DAS), flowering (85\u201390 DAS), and milk stage (105\u2013110 DAS). If very limited water (1\u20132 irrigations) is available: Apply first at CRI (20\u201325 DAS). If a second irrigation is possible, apply during the milk stage (105\u2013110 DAS). In some cases, a pre-sowing irrigation may be needed to ensure effective germination. Always plan irrigation based on recent rainfall. If significant rain occurs, irrigation can be skipped."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control yellowness in wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Yellowness in wheat can be caused by several factors, such as nutrient deficiencies (especially nitrogen and sulfur), yellow rust disease, waterlogging, or environmental stresses. If you notice yellow to orange pustules arranged in stripes along the leaf veins, and a yellow powder sticks to your finger when you rub the leaves, it may be due to yellow rust (stripe rust) disease. To control this, plant resistant varieties such as MP 4010, NW-1014 (PBW 550), and DBW 187. As soon as the first symptoms appear, spray fungicides like Propiconazole 25 EC @ 200 ml per acre or Tebuconazole 250 EC @ 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water at 15-day intervals. If older, lower leaves turn yellow first, starting from the leaf tip and progressing inward, it may be due to nitrogen deficiency. To control this, apply 50 kg urea per acre as top dressing, or a 1% urea foliar spray (10 g urea per litre of water) immediately. If patches of yellow or white stripes appear between the veins of the leaves and growth is stunted, it may be due to zinc deficiency. To fix this, apply a foliar spray of zinc sulphate 0.5% solution (5 g zinc sulphate + 2.5 g unslaked lime per litre of water). If yellowness appears on younger, upper leaves, it may be due to sulphur deficiency. To control this, apply gypsum before sowing based on soil test recommendations. For a quick fix, use a 1% foliar spray of magnesium sulphate solution (10 g magnesium sulphate + 5 g unslaked lime per litre of water). Excessive irrigation or lack of irrigation can also cause yellowing. Maintain consistent irrigation and avoid waterlogging."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to prevent frost damage in Wheat crop ?","Final Answer":"In wheat, frost forms when a surface cools through the loss of infrared radiation to a temperature colder than the dew point of the air next to the surface, and the temperature of that surface is below freezing (32\u00b0F or 0\u00b0C). To prevent frost damage, the following measures can be employed: Deploy powerful blowers to simulate wind, thereby preventing the accumulation of cold air. Cover or wrap crops, especially high-value crops. Use heating to slow the drop in temperature. Produce smoke to reduce cooling by radiation. Spray crops with water, which releases latent heat, preventing harmful freezing of plant tissues that it coats."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Blast in paddy crop ?","Final Answer":"Blast is a serious disease in the paddy (rice) crop that is caused by the fungus. It can affect all above-ground parts of the plant and cause significant yield loss. Look for diamond-shaped spots with a grey centre on leaves during the tillering stage. The most damaging stage is where the panicle neck turns black, leading to chaffy grains or panicle breakage. High nitrogen levels lead to lush, succulent growth that is more susceptible to blast. Maintain a continuous flood of 2-4 inches in the field from the tillering stage until harvest. Remove and destroy infected plant residues and weeds on bunds, as the fungus can survive on them and serve as a source of inoculum. Apply a systemic fungicide like Carbendazim 50% WP (200 grams per acre). The most. The effective time to apply fungicides is during the late boot stage and at 50% heading to prevent neck blast, which causes the most yield loss. The PHI for Carbendazim is 15 to 20 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the suitable varieties of Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a short-duration crop as well as considered a cash crop for its demand, where sowing typically occurs from June to July, with harvesting taking place between October and November. The following are some of the most popular and newly recommended varieties for cultivation in Madhya Pradesh. JR 206: Developed by Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (JNKVV), Jabalpur, this variety is a new and promising choice. It's suitable for the entire rice-growing area of the state, with a maturity period of about 120 days. JR 10: Another recommended variety from JNKVV, known for its adaptability to the entire state and a maturity period of around 120 days. It allows farmers to grow a second crop, like lentils or chickpeas, after the first crop's harvest. Swarna (MTU 7029): This is a widely popular \"mega variety\" known for its stable, high yield, and adaptability. It has excellent resistance to various biotic stresses and is a preferred choice for farmers across different regions. MTU 1010 (Jaya): A high-yielding variety that is very popular in many parts of the country, including Madhya Pradesh. It is known for its excellent yield potential and wide adaptability. Chinnor: A traditional, aromatic, and high-quality rice variety native to the Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh. It has a Geographical Indication (GI) tag and is highly sought after for its distinct fragrance and softness. JRB-1: This variety has been shown to perform well in irrigated conditions, offering superior yield compared to older, traditional varieties. JR-81: Similar to JRB-1, this variety is also recommended for irrigated areas due to its higher yield potential. The average yield of paddy in Madhya Pradesh can vary widely based on the variety, soil type, and management practices. The state's average yield is typically around 12-16 quintals per acre. With improved varieties and better management, farmers can achieve yields of 25-30 quintals per acre. Some of the newly released varieties, like JR 10, have a reported yield potential of 50-55 quintals per hectare, which translates to 20-22 quintals per acre. The ideal spacing for paddy depends on the cultivation method (transplanting or direct seeding) and the variety. Transplanting Method: 20-25 cm x 10-15 cm (Rows x Plants). Plant density: Planting 2-3 seedlings per hill is a common practice to ensure a boost in crop stand and yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Gall midge in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Gall midge is a major insect pest of paddy.. The adult is a small fly, and the damaging stage is the maggot, which feeds at the base of the growing shoot. This feeding causes the formation of a tube-like structure called a silver shoot, which prevents grain formation. An Integrated Pest Management approach is the most effective and sustainable strategy for control. Start with cultural practices like ploughing and flooding the field after harvest to destroy stubble and pupae. Remove and destroy all volunteer rice plants and alternative hosts around the field. Use resistant or tolerant varieties such as IR-36, Surekha, and Lakshmi in areas with a known history of gall midge infestation. Avoid late planting and ensure synchronous planting across a large area to break the pest's life cycle. Encourage natural biological control by conserving predators like spiders and parasitoids like Platygaster oryzae and Tetrastichus. For chemical control, insecticides should only be used when the pest incidence exceeds the Economic Threshold Level. The ETL is when one silver shoot is observed per hill during the vegetative stage. Spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at a dose of 40-50 ml\/acre in 200 liters of water with a 47-day interval period. Alternatively, spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG at a dose of 40 grams\/acre in 200 liters of water with a 21-day interval period. Another effective option is Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at a dose of 40-50 ml\/acre in 200 liters of water with a 40-day interval period. For best results, apply the spray during the early morning or late evening hours. Avoid repeated use of the same chemical class to prevent the development of resistance in the pest population."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the fertilizer dose for paddy crop ?","Final Answer":"The recommended fertilizer dose for paddy varies based on soil type, but a general guideline for soils with medium fertility is a Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium ratio of 60:30:30 kg per acre. You have to apply a total of approximately 130 kg of Urea (in three splits), 188 kg of SSP, and 50 kg of MOP per acre. The application of Nitrogen through Urea should be split into three parts. 1:3 of the Urea should be applied at the time of sowing along with the other fertilizers(it varies in different cultivation methods; use this dose in final puddling, just before transplanting). The second 1\/3rd dose of Urea should be applied 20 to 25 days after sowing, typically during the first irrigation. The final 1\/3rd dose of Urea should be applied 40 to 45 days after sowing, during the second irrigation. This split application method is crucial for maximizing nutrient uptake, promoting healthy growth, and achieving optimal yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control leaf yellowing in wheat crop ?","Final Answer":"Yellowing in wheat can be due to nutrient deficiency (N, Zn, S). Nitrogen deficiency: General yellowing of older leaves, poor growth. Apply Urea @ 45 kg\/acre with irrigation. Zinc deficiency: Yellowing between leaf veins (interveinal chlorosis) on younger leaves. Spray 0.5% Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO, -7H, O) +0.25% lime (2.5 g lime per litre), i.e. 1 kg zinc sulphate +0.5 kg lime in 200 L water\/acre. Sulphur deficiency: Uniform yellowing of younger leaves. Apply Gypsum @80 kg\/acre or Ammonium Sulphate (40 kg\/acre), water stress- Poor drainage waterlogging leads to root damage and yellowing. Excess irrigation causes leaching of nitrogen. Salinity\/alkalinity restricts nutrient uptake, showing yellow patches. Avoid both waterlogging and moisture stress. Provide irrigation at CRI, tillering, booting, and grain-filling stages. Pests (aphids\/termites)- Aphids (Telachepa) cause leaf curling, yellowing, and poor tillering (Spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 40 g\/acre in 80-100 L water), Termites attack roots, plants turn yellow and dry (Treat seed with Chlorpyriphos 20 EC @ 150 ml\/40 kg seed) or disease (yellow rust)- Rust diseases (yellow rust) -yellow stripes\/spots on leaves (spray Propiconazole 25 EC (Tilt) @ 200 ml\/acre in 200 L water)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which improved varieties of wheat are suitable for Madhya Pradesh?","Final Answer":"Wheat farming gives best result only when you sow on right time with right variety, so remember sowing time is Rabi season from 15 October to 15 November, this window gives best yield and also saves crop from diseases, late sowing till November end is possible if irrigation is there but early sowing always gives better crop, for varieties government recommends Lok-1, HI-8663 (Poshan), HI-1531 (Harshita), GW-322, JW-3173, JW-3382, JW-3211, Sujata, C-306, Amar, Amrita, Malavshree, Malav Shakti, HD-4728, HI-8759 (Pusa Tejas), HI-8737 (Pusa Anmol) and among them Lok-1 and GW-322 are famous for high yield and drought tolerance, Sujata is sharbati wheat with high protein, and HI-8663 (Poshan) is special bio-fortified for good nutrition, seed rate should be 40 kg per acre with spacing of 22\u201323 cm row to row and for late sown wheat reduce the line spacing to 15-18 cm and depth of 4\u20136 cm, crop gets ready in 120\u2013140 days around March-April, with good management you can easily get 18\u201322 quintal per acre, so just follow certified seed, timely sowing, proper spacing, soil test for balanced fertilizer and crop rotation with pulses and you will get healthy wheat crop and strong income for your family."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended seed rate for wheat?","Final Answer":"For wheat, the right seed rate makes a big difference in yield. For timely irrigated sowing, you should use 40\u201345 kg of seed per acre, and if sowing is late, then increase it to 50 kg per acre because germination and crop duration are less. Always use certified, clean seed and treat it with Thiram + Carbendazim (2:1) @ 3 g per kg seed before sowing to protect from seed-borne diseases. Sow the seed at 4\u20136 cm so it gets proper moisture, and keep row spacing of 22\u201323 cm to allow good air movement and reduce disease chances. This seed rate maintains the right plant population, avoids overcrowding, and helps the crop grow stronger. With proper seed, spacing, and fertilizer management, you can expect an average around 18\u201322 quintals per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to protect Wheat from frost? ","Final Answer":"Wheat crop often suffers from frost during winter nights, and if you do not protect it, the yield can drop badly. Frost burns leaves and even affects flowering and grain filling, sometimes cutting production by 10\u201315%. The first and most effective practice is to irrigate the field one day before frost is expected, because wet soil holds heat and keeps the crop safe. You also protect the crop by making smoke around field boundaries at night by burning husk, straw, or dry leaves, which traps heat near the ground and delays frost formation. Another simple method is dew removal \u2013 two people can run ropes gently over the crop in the early morning to shake off dew drops, so frost cannot damage leaves. In a young crop, you can cover plants with straw or dry grass to shield them. For varieties, should prefer Lok-1, GW-322, HI-1544 Purna, HD-2967, and Sujata, which are hardy and tolerate low temperatures better. Along with cultural practices, chemical sprays also help: a foliar spray of 8 to 10 kg of Urea or 8 to 10 kg of DAP dissolved in 400 to 500 liters of water per acre to make a 2% solution for foliar spray and spray once or twice at critical stages like tillering and booting to help plants recover from stress such as frost or pest damage. At the time of frost, it helps plants recover quickly. For stronger protection, use spray 0.1% Sulphuric Acid 400 ml in 400 liters of water or alternatives like Hexaconazole 200 ml\/acre, Penconazole 100 ml\/acre, mixed in 200-250 liters of water. Spray at first frost signs and repeat in 10\u201315 days if cold continues. For long-term safety, treat seeds before sowing with Thiram + Carbendazim @ 3 g\/kg seed, and always test soil at KVK or District Agriculture Office so the crop gets balanced nutrition that increases tolerance to stress. By following the steps, you can control the frost effect on the crop."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much fertilizer should be applied in wheat cultivation?","Final Answer":"Wheat farming, the right fertilizer dose and timing make all the difference in crop health and yield. For one acre, you should apply 36.5 \u2013 48.5 kg of Nitrogen, 24-25 kg, and 12- 16.2 kg to support tillering, root growth, and grain filling. The best practice is to give half nitrogen and the full dose of phosphorus and potash at sowing time, so the crop starts strong, and then apply the remaining half nitrogen at the first irrigation, around 30\u201335 days after sowing, to boost tiller growth. Always remember, balanced nutrition keeps the crop stronger against disease and stress, and if you overuse or underuse, it reduces profit and harms soil health. If soil testing shows zinc deficiency, apply Zinc Sulphate 10 kg per acre, and you can also give 2% urea spray (4 kg urea in 200 liters of water per acre) at tillering or booting stage for quick nitrogen supply. Use balanced water management: 4-6 irrigations depending on rainfall and soil type. If you follow this method\u2014proper basal dose, timely top dressing, seed treatment, and soil test-based correction\u2014you will see a stronger crop stand, more ears per plant, and easily 20\u201330% higher yield in your wheat field."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the proper time for first irrigation in wheat?","Final Answer":"In wheat, the first irrigation is most important, it should be given at 21\u201325 days after sowing, when the crop reaches the crown root initiation stage. At this stage, roots are setting deep and tillers are forming, so if the soil goes dry, the crop suffers badly and the final yield falls. After this, keep the schedule simple\u2014second irrigation around 40\u201345 days (tillering stage), third at 60\u201365 days (late jointing), and fourth irrigation at Flowering (80 days after sowing), fifth irrigation at Milk stage (95 days after sowing) and last and 6th irrigation at Dough Ripe stage (115 days after sowing), then as per need, but always save water for flowering and grain-filling. You can give around 4-6 irrigations for the wheat crop. With this simple irrigation timing, balanced fertilizer, and weed care, your wheat crop will stay green, stand strong, and give you a good yield and income."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the correct dose of urea for the Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"For wheat, use 36\u201348 kg N per acre, which is about 78\u2013104 kg urea per acre. Apply half at sowing and rest in two top dressings: first at 25\u201330 days (tillering) and second at 50\u201360 days (booting). For foliar boost, spray 2-3% urea solution, i.e., 20\u201325 kg urea in 400\u2013500 liters of water per acre, depending on spray volume, at tillering and booting. Balanced N supports tillering, root growth, and grain filling. Overuse wastes fertilizer and harms soil. Modern option: nano urea 250-500 ml nano urea per acre per spray, usually done twice (tillering and booting). By this, you can reduce urea use by 20\u201325% with a good yield. Always do a soil test at KVK before applying. Follow crop rotation and good field practices for healthy growth and higher yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the best early-maturing rice varieties ?","Final Answer":"For the Kharif season, the best early-maturing rice varieties are Purna (90 days), JRH-5, JRH-8, PS-6129, Danteshwari, Sahabhagi, CR Dhan 303, CR Dhan 308, and CR Dhan 315. Early-maturing varieties mature in 90\u2013100 days, medium-maturing varieties in 110\u2013120 days, and late-maturing varieties in 125 days or more. Sow seeds from early to mid-June up to the first week of July and maintain a spacing of 15 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants. Use 25\u201330 kg of seeds per acre for transplanting or direct seeding. Maintain proper water management to avoid stagnation and promote healthy crop growth.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage yellowing in wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat, a vital Rabi (winter) season crop, is typically sown between October and November and harvested from March to April. A common issue faced is the yellowing of wheat crops, a symptom of stress rather than a single disease. Accurately identifying the cause is essential for effective treatment. Carefully observe the pattern of yellowing in the field. If the leaves show distinct yellow stripes parallel to the veins and release a yellow-orange powder when touched, the crop is likely suffering from Yellow Rust (Pili Kungi). This is a fungal disease that requires immediate attention. If the yellowing is uniform across the leaves without any stripes, it is likely a nutrient deficiency. If the yellowing starts on the lower, older leaves and moves upwards, it indicates a nitrogen deficiency. Conversely, if it appears on the upper, newer leaves, it points to a sulfur deficiency. Yellowing can also appear in scattered patches throughout the field. This could be due to zinc deficiency, characterized by yellowing between the veins of the middle leaves, or it could be a sign of waterlogging in low-lying areas after heavy rain. Once the cause is identified, the correct treatment can be applied. For yellow rust, an immediate fungicide spray is critical. A recommended dosage is 200 ml of Propiconazole 25% EC or Tebuconazole 250 EC mixed in 200 liters of water per acre. The best long-term prevention is to sow rust-resistant varieties of wheat. Nitrogen deficiency is corrected by applying urea as a top dressing. As per JNKVV recommendations, farmers should apply 55 kg of urea per acre with the first irrigation and another 55 kg with the second irrigation. For sulfur deficiency, using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at the time of sowing is the best preventive method. If the deficiency is observed later, zinc deficiency requires a specific spray solution: 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) and 500 grams of unslaked lime mixed in 200 liters of water per acre. The lime is vital to prevent the leaves from scorching. Finally, for waterlogging, there is no chemical solution; the only remedy is to drain the excess water from the field as quickly as possible to restore proper aeration to the plant roots."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the irrigation schedule for wheat crop?","Final Answer":"No, wheat is not grown in the Kharif season. It is a Rabi season crop, which means it is sown in winter and harvested in spring. For optimal yield, wheat requires irrigation at specific critical growth stages. Missing irrigation at these times can significantly reduce yield. The most important stages are:Crown Root Initiation (CRI): Occurs approximately 20\u201325 days after sowing (DAS). Water stress during this stage severely affects root development and overall plant growth. Tillering Stage: Around 40\u201345 DAS. Proper irrigation promotes the growth of new shoots (tillers), leading to more productive spikes. Jointing Stage: At 60\u201365 DAS, the stem begins to elongate. Adequate water ensures proper stem development and nutrient uptake. Flowering Stage: Around 85\u201390 DAS, this is a critical period for grain setting. Water stress during flowering can reduce pollination and grain formation. Milk Stage: Approximately 100\u2013105 DAS. Irrigation ensures proper grain size and weight as the grains fill with a milky substance. Dough Stage: Around 115\u2013120 DAS. The final irrigation ensures that grains fully develop and mature properly."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended fertilizer dose for wheat?","Final Answer":"In your region, which falls under the Central Zone and is characterized by medium to deep black soils, a specific fertilizer schedule is recommended for wheat to ensure optimal yield. The general fertilizer dose per acre is Nitrogen (N): 48.5 kg, Phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085): 24.3 kg, Potassium (K\u2082O): 16.2 kg, and Zinc Sulfate: 10 kg. The entire quantity of P\u2082O\u2085 and K\u2082O should be applied at the time of sowing. Half of the recommended nitrogen should be applied as a basal dose, and the remaining half should be applied before the first irrigation, approximately 20\u201325 days after sowing (DAS). To supply 24.3 kg of P\u2082O\u2085, you will need 53 kg of DAP, which also provides 9.5 kg of nitrogen. To meet the remaining 39 kg of nitrogen, you will need 85 kg of urea. To supply 16.2 kg of K\u2082O, you will need 27 kg of MOP."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to increase growth in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"To increase wheat crop growth, a comprehensive strategy is required, focusing on variety selection, proper nutrient management, and timely care. Variety selection: Choose high-yielding, heat-tolerant, and disease-resistant varieties. Suitable options for the Central Zone (including Jabalpur) are HI 1634 (Pusa Ahilya), JW 3288, and HI 1544 (Pusa Mangal). These varieties are well-suited for irrigated conditions. Nutrient management:Apply 50 kg Nitrogen (N), 25 kg Phosphorus (P), and 16 kg Potash (K) per acre. Apply the full dose of phosphorus and potash along with one-third of the nitrogen as a basal dose at the time of sowing. The remaining nitrogen should be applied in two equal splits: at the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage (~21 days after sowing) and at the maximum tillering stage (~45 days after sowing). Irrigation management: Irrigation at critical growth stages is crucial. The most important stages are Crown Root Initiation (CRI), jointing, flowering, and the dough stage. Timely irrigation ensures proper root and stem development, better grain formation, and higher yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat is grown in the Rabi season. Hand weeding is a viable option, especially for small-scale farming. Performing one or two manual weedings within 30\u201345 days after sowing is a highly effective method to manage weeds and increase crop yield. This method is labor-intensive but avoids chemical use. Post-emergence herbicides are most effective when applied 25\u201335 days after sowing, when the weeds are in the 2\u20133 leaf stage. This is the critical period for weed competition. Recommended herbicides include:Clodinafop-propargyl (15% WP): Effective against grassy weeds at a typical dose of 25 g\/acre. Isoproturon (75% WP): A long-standing and effective herbicide, applied at a dose of 400 g\/acre. Metsulfuron-methyl (20% WP): Highly effective against a broad range of broadleaf weeds. A typical dose is 15 g\/acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the late sown varieties of Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat is not grown in the kharif season. It is mainly grown in the rabi season.

HI-1544: This variety is known for good grain quality and is heat-tolerant. It also provides a good yield for farmers in the region."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the Kharif season (June\u2013October) because it is a water-loving crop that needs heavy rainfall, high humidity, and warm temperatures (25\u201335\u00b0C) for proper growth. In the Zaid season (March\u2013June), the weather is hot and dry with limited water availability, which makes it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. An integrated approach using cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is the most effective way to control weeds in paddy. Many weeds can be controlled by applying pre-sowing irrigation to the area where the nursery or seedlings are to be transplanted. The emerged weeds can be ploughed under. For chemical control, apply herbicides like Metsulfuron Methyl 10 + Chlorimuron Ethyl 10 WP at 8 g\/acre or Anilophos 24 + 2,4-D-ethyl ester 32 EC at 400-600 ml\/acre at 3-10 days after transplanting. Apply Butachlor 50 EC at 1-1.6 l\/acre, Pretilachlor 50 EC at 400-600 ml\/acre, Oxadiargyl 80 WP at 50 g\/acre, Chlorimuron Ethyl 25 WP + Surfactant at 9.6 g\/acre, or Cinmethylin 10 EC at 300-400 ml\/acre as pre-emergence within 4-6 days after transplanting. Apply Cyhalofop-butyl 10 EC at 300-320 ml\/acre at 18-20 days after sowing in grassy weeds in direct-seeded rice, followed by one hand weeding given after 4-6 weeks. Always follow the label instructions and PHI (pre-harvest interval) for each herbicide to ensure safe grain quality."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the fertilizer dose in Paddy?","Final Answer":"A balanced application of fertilizers is crucial for a high-yielding paddy (rice) crop. The fertilizer schedule is typically divided into a basal application (at the time of transplanting) and one or two top dressings. Soil testing must be done to determine the quantity of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash on the basis of the test. The general recommendation for NPK fertilizer for paddy in Madhya Pradesh, where both high-yielding varieties and hybrids are grown, is Nitrogen: 40-50 kg per acre, Phosphorus: 24-28 kg per acre, and Potassium: 16-24 kg per acre. Apply the full dose of Phosphorus and Potassium, and a third of the Nitrogen. You can achieve these grades by using approximately 50-60 kg of DAP per acre; you will need approximately 25-30 kg of MOP per acre. The remaining two-thirds of the Nitrogen (N) should be applied in two split doses to ensure a continuous supply throughout the crop's life cycle. Apply approximately 40-45 kg of Urea per acre at around 20-25 days after transplanting (DAT), at the tillering stage. Apply another 40-45 kg of Urea per acre at 40-45 DAT, at the panicle initiation stage. For zinc-deficient soils, which are common in Madhya Pradesh, apply 10 kg of Zinc Sulphate per acre as a basal dose. Applying 4-6 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM per acre during land preparation is highly recommended to improve soil health and fertility."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Leaf yellowing in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Leaf yellowing in wheat is a common issue that can be caused by several factors. The two primary causes are nutrient deficiencies and fungal diseases. If the yellowing begins on the older, lower leaves and moves upward, it is likely a nitrogen deficiency. For this, a top dressing of urea is recommended. The application dose is 20 to 25 kilograms of urea per acre. Apply the urea and then provide light irrigation to help it incorporate into the soil. A single application is usually sufficient if the problem is addressed early. If the yellowing appears between the veins on the middle leaves, it may indicate a zinc deficiency. For this, a foliar spray is the most effective solution. Use zinc sulfate heptahydrate at a rate of 1.0 to 1.5 kilograms\/acre. Dissolve the zinc in 200 liters of water for spraying. Apply two sprays, with the second application coming 15 to 20 days after the first. If the yellowing appears as stripes of powdery pustules or irregular spots, a fungal disease like yellow rust is the cause. For curative control, a fungicide like a tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin combination is effective. The application dose is 150 to 200 ml\/acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. A single spray is often enough, but a follow-up application after 15 days may be needed for severe cases. For a protective spray against fungal diseases, mancozeb can be used. The application dose is 400 to 500 grams\/acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. Sprays should be repeated every 10 to 15 days if the weather remains cool and humid."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control diseases in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"The major diseases of wheat are the rusts, particularly brown rust (leaf rust) and black rust (stem rust), along with loose smut. Brown rust symptoms, including small, oval, reddish-brown pustules, appear scattered randomly on the upper surface of the leaves, and in severe infections, leaves turn yellow and prematurely dry. Avoid sowing wheat varieties like WH-147, HI-1500, MP1202, GW322, and GW 273, which are highly susceptible to brown rust, and choose varieties such as MP 3382, HI 1544, HI 8759, HI 1636, DBW 187, DBW 303, MP 1203, MP 1323, and MP 3288, which show resistance against brown rust. To control brown rust, use rust-resistant varieties, avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer, monitor the crop regularly during December to February during the cool humid season, and if you notice any symptoms, spray fungicide. Spray fungicides such as Propiconazole 25% EC at 200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water or Tebuconazole 25% EC at 200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water as soon as you notice symptoms. A timely spray can prevent the disease from spreading. Black rust (stem rust) symptoms include reddish-brown, elongated pustules on the stems and leaf sheaths. As the season progresses and plants mature, the pustules turn black, and in severe infections, the plants fall over and produce shrivelled grains. To control this, plant rust-resistant varieties, remove and destroy infected plants, and spray fungicides such as Propiconazole 25% EC at 200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water or Tebuconazole 25% EC at 200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water as soon as you notice symptoms. Loose smut is a seed-borne disease that affects wheat heads, and the entire ear (inflorescence) is replaced by a black, powdery mass of spores. To control this, treat the seed with Carbendazim 50% WP at 2 g\/kg seed or Tebuconazole 2% DS at 1.25 g\/kg seed before sowing and remove and destroy infected plants."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the irrigation schedule of Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"For an optimal yield, wheat requires a total water supply of 40-45 cm (400-450 mm). This includes both rainfall and irrigation. The number and timing of irrigations are crucial, as water stress at specific growth stages can drastically reduce the final yield. For the black soil, which has good water-holding capacity, 3 to 4 irrigations are generally sufficient. For lighter soils, 5 to 6 irrigations may be needed. First irrigation should be given at the crown root initiation (CRI) stage, 20-25 days after sowing. The second irrigation can be at the tillering stage at 40-45 DAS. The third irrigation can be given at a late jointing\/booting stage, 60-65 DAS. Fourth irrigation at flowering stage 80-85 DAS. For the fifth irrigation, you can give it at the dough stage\/grain filling, 115-120 DAS."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I apply Urea in 1st Irrigation of the Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Yes, you absolutely can and should apply urea at the first irrigation of your wheat crop. This is one of the most crucial fertilizer applications for wheat and is highly recommended. The first irrigation of wheat is given at the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage, which occurs approximately 20-25 days after sowing (DAS). This is a very critical growth stage for the wheat plant. The application of nitrogen (from urea) at this stage, combined with the irrigation, helps in the development of tillers (side shoots). A greater number of healthy tillers leads to more ear heads, directly increasing the final yield. Vegetative Growth: Nitrogen is a key component of chlorophyll and proteins. Supplying it at the CRI stage gives the plant the necessary boost for vigorous vegetative growth and biomass production. The exact dosage of urea depends on the total nitrogen requirement of your crop. As per the recommended fertilizer schedule for wheat, the total nitrogen dose is typically split into three parts. For the first irrigation, you should apply approximately 55 kg of urea per acre. The best way to apply urea at this stage is by broadcasting it evenly across the field. Apply the urea just before giving the first irrigation or on a moist field immediately after irrigation. This ensures that the urea dissolves and the nitrogen is carried down to the root zone, minimizing the loss of nitrogen through volatilization (conversion to gas). The first irrigation should be light. This helps the roots grow deeper and makes the plants more resistant to lodging (falling over)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much fertilizer should be applied in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Paddy is cultivated as a Kharif crop rather than during the Zaid season. \n\nFor rice, the fertilizer amount varies depending on the crop duration.\n\nFor early-maturing varieties (<100 days), apply approximately 35-44 kg of urea, 17-26 kg of DAP, and 10-13 kg of MOP per acre. About 18 kg of urea per acre is applied 6-7 days after transplanting, followed by 9 kg of urea at 35-40 days, and another 9 kg at 50-60 days.\n\nFor medium-duration types (110-125 days), the requirement increases to about 70-87 kg of urea, 26-35 kg of DAP, and 13-17 kg of MOP per acre. Approximately 20 kg of urea per acre is given 6-7 days after transplanting, 25 kg at 45-55 days, and another 25 kg at 60-70 days.\n\nLate-maturing varieties (125+ days) need a higher dose of around 87-104 kg of urea, 43\u201352 kg of DAP, and 20\u201327 kg of MOP per acre, while hybrid rice requires the most\u2014about 104 kg of urea, 52 kg of DAP, and 27 kg of MOP per acre. About 20 kg of urea per acre is applied 6-7 days after transplanting, followed by 25 kg at 50-60 days, and 35 kg at 65-75 days.\n\nAdditionally, zinc sulphate should be applied at a rate of 10 kg per acre once every 2\u20133 years, preferably at sowing or transplanting, to prevent deficiency. This split application improves nutrient availability, reduces nitrogen losses, and supports higher yields.\nThe nitrogen supplied through DAP should be considered when adjusting the urea dose to prevent over-application."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Rust in Wheat Crop?","Final Answer":"Rust is one of the most serious diseases of wheat and includes yellow rust (stripe rust), leaf rust (brown rust), and stem rust (black rust). To control leaf rust, stem rust, and yellow rust, sow early (within the recommended sowing window) to escape peak infection periods. Avoid excess nitrogen application, which makes plants more susceptible. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle. Remove and destroy volunteer wheat plants (\u201cself-sown\u201d or ratoon wheat) that harbour rust pathogens. For effective rust management in wheat, natural enemies promote biodiversity, as this helps maintain a balanced ecosystem that naturally suppresses disease spread. If rust symptoms appear, chemical control may be necessary. Propiconazole 25% EC can be applied at 200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water with a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of about 30 days, while Tebuconazole 25% EC may also be used at 200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water, with a PHI of around 35 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the seed treatment methods in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy (Rice) is primarily a Kharif crop, but it is also grown to a smaller extent as a Rabi crop in irrigated areas. Seed treatment of paddy is a critical step for preventing diseases and pests from the very beginning. The best seed treatment uses a combination of fungicide and insecticide to provide dual protection. Treat the seeds with fungicide Carbendazim 2.5 gram\/kg seed or Carbendazim + Mancozeb 3 gram\/kg seed, or Carboxin + Thiram 3 gram\/kg seed. Apply 1 gram of Imidacloprid 70% WS per kilogram of seed. This provides systemic protection to the seedlings from sucking pests like termites and aphids for up to 30 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is primarily a Kharif crop. The sowing of paddy takes place during the monsoon season (June to July), and it is harvested in October to November. Controlling weeds in paddy crops is typically done through an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach that combines manual, mechanical, and chemical methods. Hand weeding is a highly effective, traditional method. Two rounds of hand weeding, often at 20 and 40 days after sowing (DAS), provide excellent control and lead to high yields. Pre-emergence Herbicides (applied before weeds emerge), Pretilachlor 50% EC: The recommended dose is 500 ml per acre for controlling weeds in transplanted rice. It is typically used within 4 days of transplanting. Or Bensulfuron methyl 0.6% + Pretilachlor 6% GR: Apply at a dose of 4 kg per acre, mixed with 4 kg of sand, within 5-10 days after transplanting. Post-emergence Herbicides (applied after weeds have emerged), Bispyribac-sodium 10% SC: A common and highly effective herbicide for broad-spectrum weed control. The recommended dose is 80 ml per acre. This is typically sprayed when weeds are at the 2-3 leaf stage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Blast disease in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy (rice) is primarily a Kharif crop. Controlling paddy blast  requires a combination of cultural practices, proper nutrient management, and timely fungicide application. After harvest, remove and destroy infected plant residue to eliminate a source of the pathogen for the next crop cycle. Maintaining continuous flooding in the paddy field can help to create an unfavorable environment for the blast fungus. Fungicide application is the most direct way to control an outbreak. The timing is crucial for a successful application. Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG: This combination has shown excellent results in controlling leaf and neck blast. The dose is typically 120-140 grams per acre. Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 11.4% SC: A common combination product for broad-spectrum control. The recommended dose is around 200 ml per acre. Apply the initial spray at the first sign of leaf blast, which appears as spindle-shaped lesions on the leaves. A follow-up spray is crucial during the panicle emergence stage to protect against neck blast, which can result in significant yield loss."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control White grub in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"White grubs are the larval stage of scarab beetles and are serious soil-dwelling pests of paddy. They feed on the roots of rice plants, causing reduced nutrient uptake, stunted growth, yellowing, and even plant death. Effective management requires an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods. Chemical control is most effective when targeted at the early larval stages, coinciding with pre-monsoon rains or soon after transplanting. Imidacloprid 70% WS is recommended at a dose of 10-15 g\/kg seed. Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC is an effective option applied at 60-80 ml\/acre as a soil drench. It provides long residual control and is generally safer for beneficial insects. Thiamethoxam 25% WG can be used at 80-100 grams\/acre applied as a soil drench during peak adult activity. For a bio-rational approach, a combination of Metarhizium anisopliae fungus (2.5 kg) with a reduced rate of Imidacloprid (8 ml) mixed with FYM and broadcast per acre is highly effective. Always ensure the field has adequate soil moisture at the time of application for the insecticide to reach the root zone. Apply all chemicals during the evening hours to minimize degradation and target the pest when it is most active. Cultural controls like deep summer ploughing to expose grubs and setting up light traps to catch adult beetles are crucial. Biological control using entomopathogenic fungi like Beauveria bassiana or nematodes provides sustainable management. Regular monitoring is essential; a threshold of 5-6 grubs\/square meter is considered economically damaging."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control termites in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Termites attack the crop both soon after sowing and again before maturity. They feed on the roots and stems of young plants, causing them to dry out completely, and they are easy to pull from the soil. If the damage occurs at later growth stages, the plants often produce white, chaffy ears without grains. Termite incidence is usually higher in unirrigated fields and in soils where undecomposed farmyard manure has been applied before sowing. To control them, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical measures is recommended. Do deep ploughing of the field during summer, apply neem cake at 80 kg per acre before sowing, remove and destroy any crop residue, stubble, or woody material from the previous crop, and maintain proper irrigation, as they are primarily active in dry unirrigated soils. Place four earthen pots per acre, each filled with about 500 maize gullies without seed, or place 1 kg of raw cow dung at 10 spots in the field, which helps to attract termites, which can then be destroyed easily. You can use beneficial fungi like Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, which can kill termites. Treat the seeds with 1 gm Thiamethoxam 70 WS or 4 ml Chlorpyrifos 20 EC per kg of wheat seeds. In case of serious infestation, broadcast Fipronil 0.3 G at 7 kg per acre or Chlorpyrifos 20 EC at 1.2 liters per acre with 20 kg of moist sand before the first irrigation. Chlorpyrifos is used under restriction, so use it under proper expert guidance."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the proper method of seed treatment in Gram and Wheat crops?","Final Answer":"Seed treatment is a crucial and cost-effective practice to protect the seeds and seedlings from various seed- or soil-borne diseases and early-season pests. Bengal gram is highly susceptible to fungal diseases, so treating the seed with fungicides is the first and most important step. The recommended fungicides for effective seed treatment are Thiram 75 WP at 3 grams\/kg of seeds, Thiram 2 grams + Mancozeb 1 gram per kg of seed, or Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP at 2 grams per kg of seed. If you want to use a biological option, you can use Trichoderma viride at 4-6 grams per kg of seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens at 5-10 grams per kg of seed. When the seed is dried, treat it with Thiamethoxam 70WS at 3 grams per kg of seed or Imidacloprid 600 FS at 3-4 ml per kg of seed. Bengal gram is a legume that fixes atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. So it is necessary to treat seeds with rhizobium culture after fungicide and pesticide treatment to ensure that the plants get enough nitrogen for healthy growth, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. After chemical treatments have dried, prepare a 10% jaggery (gur) solution (100 g jaggery in 1 liter of water) to use as a sticker for biofertilizers. Or for every 10\u201312 kg of seed, use 200\u2013250 g of Rhizobium culture and 200\u2013250 g of PSB culture. Sprinkle the cultures over the seeds with the jaggery solution and mix gently until uniformly coated. Spread the treated seed in a thin layer in the shade and dry for about 30 minutes; do not dry in direct sunlight. Sow the treated seed on the same day to preserve the viability of Rhizobium and PSB. If you use Trichoderma viride or Pseudomonas fluorescens for seed treatment, do not apply chemical fungicide to the same seed lot. Seed treatment in wheat is necessary to protect the seed from seed- or soil-borne diseases and early-season pests. Treat seed before sowing with Carboxin 75 WP at 2.5-3 grams per kg seed, Carbendazim 50 WP at 2.5-3 grams per kg seed, or Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS at 2.5-3 grams per kg seed to protect against major fungal disease. Additionally, treat seeds with Tebuconazole 2% DS at 1.15 grams per kg of seed to protect against loose smut\/Kandwa disease. In termite-infected soil, treat the seed with Chlorpyrifos 20 EC at 4 ml per kg of seed or Thiamethoxam 70 FS at 1 gram per kg of seed before sowing. After chemical treatment, when the seed is dried, you can treat the seeds with PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) culture, which significantly increases the availability of phosphorus to the plant. The recommended dose is typically 5 to 10 grams of PSB culture per kilogram of seed."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I do weed management in my wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Weed management in wheat is crucial, as uncontrolled weeds can cause significant yield losses by competing for nutrients, water, and light. An integrated approach using cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective for the MP region. The choice of herbicide depends on the predominant type of weeds in your field, whether they are broadleaf weeds or grassy weeds. For broad-spectrum control, a pre-emergence application is often recommended. Apply Pendimethalin 30% EC at a dose of 800-1000 ml\/acre. This herbicide should be applied immediately after sowing but before the germination of the wheat crop. It must be mixed in 120-150 liters of water\/acre for uniform spraying. Pendimethalin is effective against a range of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds. For post-emergence control of grassy weeds like wild oat and Phalaris minor, specific herbicides are used. Clodinafop-propargyl 15% WP is an effective choice against grassy weeds. The recommended dose is 140-160 grams\/acre. It should be applied when weeds are in the 2-4 leaf stage, typically 30-35 days after sowing. Mix the herbicide in 120-150 liters of water\/acre for application. The waiting period for this herbicide is 90 days. For the control of broadleaf weeds like Chenopodium and Mustard, use 2,4-D Ethyl Ester 38% EC. The recommended dose is 300-400 ml\/acre. The application should be done 35-40 days after sowing, during the active growth stage of the weeds. It must be mixed in 120-150 liters of water. The waiting period for 2,4-D is 60-70 days. A ready-mix herbicide like Metsulfuron-methyl 10% + Chlorimuron-ethyl 10% WP can control both grassy and broadleaf weeds. The dose for this mix is 20 grams\/acre. Apply it for 30-35 days after sowing, mixed in 120-150 liters of water. The waiting period is 60 days. Always use a flat fan nozzle for uniform spray coverage, and avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift. Ensure the field has sufficient moisture at the time of herbicide application for best results. Adhering to the recommended waiting period is essential to ensure that pesticide residues are within safe limits at harvest."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control sucking pests in Paddy?","Final Answer":"The main sucking pests in paddy are the green leafhopper and the brown plant hopper. Both pests suck the cell sap, particularly from the leaf sheath, and the crop dries up in patches. As the plants dry up, the hoppers migrate to the adjoining plants and kill them. In a few days, the area of the dry patches will enlarge. Not only these, but they also transmit viral diseases. To control them, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach combining cultural, biological, mechanical, and chemical measures is recommended. To control the brown plant hopper, avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer, maintain proper spacing to reduce humidity, drain the rice field for 3-4 days when heavy infestation occurs, use early-maturing varieties, and follow synchronous planting. If you have seen a minimum of 5 planthoppers floating in water, spray insecticide such as Pymetrozine 50% WG @120-130 grams per acre in 200 liters of water, or Buprofezin 25% SC at @ 400 ml per acre in 200 liters of water, or imidacloprid 17.8 SL at @ 60 ml per acre in 200 liters of water. For controlling green leafhoppers, avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertilizer, follow synchronized planting, remove weeds from the field or nearby bunds, and use insecticides such as Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at @ 60 ml per acre in 200 liters of water or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 grams per acre in 200 liters of water. Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance, spray directly towards the base of plants for brown plant hopper, and check the product label for PHI(Pre-Harvest Interval) period."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control rats in field?","Final Answer":"For effective rodent pest management in fields, it is essential to practice clean cultivation by destroying burrows, removing weeds and alternate food sources, and using paddy straw or other natural materials for burrow smoking. Encouraging natural predators like barn owls by installing perches or wooden boxes also helps. Community action is very important, with campaigns of rodent control organized 6 weeks after transplanting. Practice poison baiting with anticoagulant, bromadiolone at 0.005% (96 parts of broken rice + 2 parts of edible oil + 2 parts of 0.25% CB bromadiolone). For 1 kg of bait, broken rice 960 g with edible oil (groundnut\/sesame): 20 g (\u224820 ml) and Bromadiolone 0.25% concentrate: 20 g. This yields 0.005% bromadiolone bait. On Day 1, close all the burrows in the fields, field bunds, canal bunds, and surrounding barren lands, etc. On the second day, count the reopened burrows and treat the burrows with Bromadiolone chemical bait packets at 10 g\/burrow. On the 10th day, observe the reopened burrows and repeat baiting. Be sure to wear gloves and keep baits away from children, livestock, and water sources.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Root rot in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Root rot in wheat, mainly caused by Fusarium and Rhizoctonia spp., can be effectively managed through a combination of seed treatment, biocontrol, and cultural practices. Some of the cultural practices are to follow crop rotation with non-cereal crops (pulses, oilseeds) to reduce inoculum buildup. Use well-drained fields; avoid waterlogging or prolonged drought stress. Remove and destroy infected stubble and residues after harvest. Maintain optimum plant population; avoid dense sowing. Seed treatment is done by treating the seeds with Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride at 10 g\/kg seed as part of biological control. Thiram 75% WP at 2.5 g\/kg seed or Tebuconazole 2% DS at 1.25 g\/kg seed can also be used for seed treatment. Some of the soil management methods are the application of well-decomposed FYM\/organic manure to improve soil health. Apply neem cake at 100 kg\/acre during field preparation. Use bio-agents like Trichoderma-enriched FYM (1 kg culture in 25 kg FYM, incubated 7 days, applied at sowing)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control  leaf miner in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Leaf miner larvae tunnel between the layers of rice leaves - creating pale, winding mines that reduce photosynthesis and can weaken young seedlings. To manage them effectively, farmers should adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach. To control leaf miners, the cultural & water management maintains shallow flooding (3-4 inches) initially to encourage rice leaves to grow upright quickly, as miners prefer leaves lying flat on the water. Ensure field hygiene levels are properly maintained and remove weeds or grass hosts near the field, which can harbour leaf miner eggs and larvae. Monitoring starts by inspecting 2\u20134 weeks after transplanting. If more than 20% of plants have eggs or larvae per square foot, or plant stands are low with 10% infestation, reduce water depth to let leaves lift off the surface-this reduces damage naturally. Supplement with egg parasitoids where available; releasing Trichogramma species (e.g., T. chilonis or T. japonicum) at rates like 40000 parasitoids per acre weekly for several weeks can help target leaf miner eggs and reduce infestations. Chemical Control: As a last resort, consider spot applications of chlorantraniliprole at @ 60 ml in 200 liters of water. Ensure to follow a pre-harvest interval of 47 days to avoid contamination."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"When should I sow wheat in my field?","Final Answer":"For timely sown wheat with restricted irrigation (20 October\u201310 November, 1\u20132 irrigations), suitable choices include DBW 359 (Karan Shivangi), CG 1040, and NIAW 4028 (Phule Anurag) among bread wheats and HI 8840 (Pusa Gehun Gaurav) or HI 1665 (Pusa Gehun Sharbati) among durums.

For late-sown irrigated wheat (1 December\u20135 January, 4\u20135 irrigations), farmers should opt for heat- and rust-tolerant varieties such as DBW 316 (Karan Prema). Seeds of these modern varieties should be procured from certified agencies or KVKs to ensure genuine quality and maximum benefit."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the effective control measures of soil insects in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Start with cultural measures: apply only well-rotted FYM (fresh or partly rotted manure encourages termites), avoid late sowing, practice deep summer ploughing or expose the soil to destroy termite galleries and pupae, and maintain good field sanitation by removing old roots and stubble that harbour termite colonies. For chemical protection at sowing, treat seeds or apply chemicals in the seed row: Thiamethoxam 30% FS at 10 ml\/kg seed (400 ml for 40 kg of seed). For soil\/row application, Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 10 kg\/acre at sowing is recommended to protect emerging seedlings. Maintain a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 91 days to avoid contamination."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the control measures of Aphids in the Wheat crop","Final Answer":"The wheat crop is most vulnerable to aphid damage during the booting-to-dough stage, when aphids feed on plant sap, leading to reduced grain size and yield. The feeding activity of wheat aphids can cause several detrimental effects on wheat plants. Infested plants often exhibit stunted growth, chlorosis (yellowing of leaves), wilting, and reduced yield. Regularly check your wheat crop for aphid colonies. The economic threshold is reached when you find 10\u201315 aphids per earhead or 20\u201325 aphids per tiller. Taking action at this stage is crucial to prevent significant yield loss. Sowing wheat at the recommended time for the region (typically late October to mid-November) helps the crop avoid peak aphid infestation periods, which often occur during warmer spells in late winter. If the aphid population exceeds the economic threshold, chemical control becomes necessary: Imidacloprid 17.8% SL: A systemic insecticide highly effective against aphids at a dose of 50 ml per acre. Thiamethoxam 25% WG: Another systemic insecticide from the same class as imidacloprid, used at about 40 grams per acre. Neem Oil: An organic option that can be effective in the early stages of infestation."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the control measures of fungal attack in the Wheat crop","Final Answer":"The most prevalent fungal diseases affecting wheat crops are rusts (brown, yellow, and black) and Karnal bunt. These pathogens can cause significant yield and quality losses. Plant the crop at the optimal time (late October to mid-November) to avoid the crop's most susceptible stages coinciding with peak fungal conditions. Avoid planting wheat in the same field continuously. Rotate it with non-host crops like legumes or oilseeds to break the disease cycle and reduce fungal spore buildup in the soil. Do not use excessive nitrogen fertilizer, as this can lead to lush growth that is more susceptible to rusts. If rust symptoms appear, a foliar spray is highly effective. Propiconazole 25% EC: A common and effective systemic fungicide, recommended at a dose of 200 ml per acre. Azoxystrobin 11% + Tebuconazole 18.3% SC: A combination product providing both preventive and curative action. Apply at a dose of 200 ml per acre. For rust, apply the fungicide as soon as the first pustules appear. For Karnal bunt, a preventive spray is recommended at the booting or ear emergence stage. The PHI for propiconazole on wheat is 30 days, and for the azoxystrobin + tebuconazole mix, it is 35 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about the control of sucking pests in Wheat","Final Answer":"The primary sucking pest in wheat crops is the aphid. These small insects feed on plant sap, particularly during the heading and grain-filling stages, leading to shriveled grains and reduced yield. Regularly monitor the crop, especially from the booting stage onwards. The economic threshold for intervention is reached when the aphid population reaches 10-15 aphids per earhead or an average of 20-25 aphids per tiller. If the aphid population exceeds the economic threshold, a targeted foliar spray of a systemic insecticide is required. Imidacloprid 17.8% SL: A highly effective systemic insecticide at a dose of 50-60 ml per acre. Apply a single spray once the economic threshold is reached. Or Thiamethoxam 25% WG: Another systemic insecticide with excellent efficacy against aphids, at a dose of 40 grams per acre. Always mix these insecticides in 200 liters of water per acre for proper coverage. Apply in the evening to protect beneficial insects and pollinators."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the timely sown and late sown varieties of Wheat crop in irrigated condition?","Final Answer":"For irrigated wheat farming, you should choose the proper variety according to timely or late sowing, because yield and profit fully depend on the seed type and irrigation. For timely sown irrigated crops, good choices are HD 3410 (biofortified, high protein (12.6%), rust resistant, Karnal bunt resistant, Pusa Jawahar Gehun), giving around 26 q\/acre; HD 3249 (high yielding, biofortified, rust and wheat blast resistant, best for chapati), giving 22\u201330 q\/acre; HD 3226 (multiple rust and disease resistant, high protein), giving 23\u201332 q\/acre; HDCSW 18 (suited for conservation agriculture, early sowing (mid-October)), about 25 q\/acre; and HI 1634 (Pusa Ahilya), around 21 q\/acre. JW 3211, HI 1544, JW 1142, MPO 1215, JW 1201, and HI 1531 also perform well. For late or very late sowing, farmers can take HI 1634 (Pusa Ahilya) with 21 q\/acre, HD 3271 with 15 q\/acre, HD 3298 with 16 q\/acre, WR 544 with 15 q\/acre, and local late varieties like JW 3269, JW 3173, and JW 3020. For all conditions, use 40 kg of seed per acre with a row spacing of 23 cm for timely irrigated sowing and 25 cm for unirrigated\/semi-irrigated. On average, you can get a yield of 20-25 q\/acre under irrigated conditions and 17.4-18.2 q\/acre under two irrigation conditions. This will help you plan harvest expectations for timely sown and two-irrigation conditions. Remember that even two well-timed irrigations at crown root initiation and flowering can increase yield by 25\u201330% compared to rainfed. Always prefer high-yielding and disease-resistant seed, sow at the proper time, and follow the seed rate and irrigation carefully. This way, you can get a good harvest and better profit from wheat."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control False smut in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"False Smut is a significant fungal disease of paddy caused by Ustilaginoidea virens. It transforms individual grains into smut balls, reducing yield and quality. Management requires a preventive approach as chemicals are ineffective once symptoms appear. An Integrated Disease Management approach is crucial for control. Use certified disease-free seeds from a reliable source. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer application, which promotes lush, susceptible growth. Maintain balanced nutrition with proper potassium application. Remove and destroy infected smut balls and stubble after harvest. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops. Fungicide application is only effective as a preventive measure. The critical timing for spraying is just before the booting stage. A second application during the panicle emergence stage is also recommended. Spraying after the disease appears is completely ineffective. Use 200 to 250 liters of water\/acre for good coverage. Recommended preventive fungicides include Propiconazole 25% EC at 200 to 250 ml\/acre with a pre-harvest interval of 28 to 30 days.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control nematodes in wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Nematodes, particularly the cereal cyst nematode, can be a hidden constraint to wheat production. They cause stunted growth, yellowing, and significant yield loss. An integrated nematode management strategy is the most effective and sustainable approach. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like mustard or chickpea in 3 years. This breaks the nematode's life cycle effectively. Perform summer deep ploughing to expose the nematodes and their cysts to the sun. Use resistant or tolerant wheat varieties where available. Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure at 5 to 6 tonnes per acre to encourage natural enemies. Use bio-control agents like Paecilomyces lilacinus fungus at 1 to 2 kg\/acre mixed with FYM. Chemical control should be considered a last resort if nematode populations are very high. These are best applied as soil treatments at or before sowing. Recommended chemical options include Carbofuran 3% CG granules at 16 to 17 kg\/acre. (Use it under the guidance of an agri expert.) or fipronil 0.3 GR (600-800gm\/acre). Apply the granules evenly in the soil during the last ploughing or in furrows at sowing. It is important to note that liquid nematicides are highly toxic and generally not recommended for wheat. The granular formulations are more practical options. There is no pre-harvest interval for these soil applications at sowing time. The most important first step is to get a soil nematode assay done. This confirms the type and population level of nematodes present. Contact your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra or soil lab for testing."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control rodents attack in Wheat crop field?","Final Answer":"Rodents damage wheat fields mainly by feeding on seeds, seedlings, tillers, and mature grains, which reduces plant density and overall yield. At the early stage, they dig up and eat sown seeds or young seedlings, resulting in gaps and uneven crop stands. During maturity, rodents feed on wheat spikes, pulling out or eating the grains directly from the heads, which causes significant yield loss. To control this, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical measures is recommended. After the rabi season (winter crop like wheat) and before the kharif season (monsoon crop), deep ploughing the fields during the hot summer months can destroy rodent burrows and expose the rodents and their young to the sun and predators. Keep the field and its surroundings free from weeds, as weeds provide shelter and resting sites for rodents. During the early stages of the crop, identify and fill active rodent burrows with a mixture of mud, cow dung, and straw. Encourage natural predators such as owls, snakes, and feral cats by installing perches or nest boxes near fields. Harvest the wheat crop as soon as it is mature. Rodents often cause the most damage during the ripening and pre-harvest stages. In case of severe infestation, use poison bait. But before using poisonous bait, use nonpoisonous bait such as plain wheat flour, jaggery, and groundnut oil for 2-3 days. Replace non-poisonous bait with poisonous bait such as Zinc Phosphide 2.4% or Bromadiolone 0.005%. Place the bait on paper or small containers near the active rodent burrow for effective control. Consult with the local KVK or extension officer for more effective approaches."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Caterpillars and sucking pests in the Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"To manage sucking pests like brown planthopper (BPH), white-backed planthopper (WBPH), and green leafhopper (GLH), it is essential to adopt multiple practices. Culturally, restrict rice cropping to two crops per year, and synchronize planting across fields within 3 weeks, which disrupts pest and virus-vector cycles. Use older seedlings (> 3 weeks) for transplanting, and practice early planting in the season to escape peak pest activity. \n\nApply nitrogen judiciously in split doses (avoid >25 kg urea\/acre at one time) to discourage hopper buildup and improve plant tolerance. Maintain good weed control in the field and bunds, and rotate rice with non-rice crops in the dry season to break pest cycles. During heavy hopper infestations, drain the field for 3\u20134 days to suppress populations.\n\n Resistant varieties preferred for Brown Plant Hopper are Vijetha, Chaitanya, Mansarovar, Pant Dhan 11, Rajshree; for White Backed Plant Hopper is HKR 120, PR 108, Pant Dhan 1 the 0 and for Green LeafHoppere,  Vikramarya, Nidhi, IR 24 are effective. \nMechanical measures include removal of infested plant parts and seedling tip clipping before transplanting to reduce pest carryover. Collect egg masses of pests and place them in bamboo cages to conserve parasitoids.\nEncourage natural enemies like spiders, mirid bugs, and parasitoid wasps by minimizing unnecessary sprays. If pest populations exceed ETL (10\u201320 hoppers\/hill for planthoppers, or 2\u20133 bugs\/hill for gundhi bug), apply selective insecticides such as imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 40-50 ml or thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 40 g\/acre in 200 liters of water and as basal-directed sprays.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding control measures of fungal attack in Paddy ","Final Answer":"Paddy crop is susceptible to several major fungal diseases, including rice blast, sheath blight, and false smut. To effectively manage these diseases, an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach is recommended. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer application, as this can increase the plant's susceptibility to diseases. Practice intermittent wetting and drying of the rice fields, particularly after the tillering stage. Draining the field can reduce humidity and inhibit the growth of fungi like Rhizoctonia solani, which causes sheath blight. Avoid close planting to ensure good air circulation within the crop canopy, which helps to lower humidity and reduce disease spread.  In case of leaf blast incidence, spray Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG at a dose of 80g per acre diluted in 200 litres of water per acre, at the early appearance of blast symptoms. If there is infection of sheath blight, on the appearance of diseases in 1-2 tillers, spray Validamycin 3% L at a dose of 400ml per acre, using 200 liters of water per acre. False Smut disease, which causes individual grains to turn into yellow-to-green spore balls, is managed with Propiconazole 25% EC. This fungicide is effective when applied at the booting stage of the crop. The recommended dose is 200 ml per acre, diluted in 200 liters of water per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to enhance the growth and control the Yellowing of leaves in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Yellowing in a wheat crop can be a major concern for farmers, as it often indicates a health issue that can lead to reduced growth and lower yields. To ensure robust and high-yielding wheat, several management practices are recommended. Apply fertilizers based on soil test results. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are particularly important for wheat growth. Deficiencies in micronutrients like sulfur (S), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) can also hamper growth. In some cases, yellowing can be a sign of sulfur deficiency, which is often confused with nitrogen deficiency. Providing water at the critical growth stages, such as the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage (20-25 days after sowing), tillering, and flowering, is essential for optimal growth. Over-irrigation can lead to waterlogging and yellowing of the crop. Yellowness (chlorosis) in wheat can be caused by various factors, from nutrient deficiencies to diseases and pests. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency: This is the most common cause of yellowing. The symptoms typically appear first on the oldest (lower) leaves, as nitrogen is a mobile nutrient and the plant moves it to newer growth. Apply supplemental nitrogen fertilizer, such as urea or urea ammonium nitrate solution, as a top dressing. Sulfur (S) Deficiency: This can look similar to nitrogen deficiency, but it appears on the younger (upper) leaves first, as sulfur is an immobile nutrient. Apply a sulfur-containing fertilizer like gypsum or a fertilizer like ammonium sulfate, which contains both nitrogen and sulfur. Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust): This is a fungal disease that can be devastating for wheat. It causes bright yellow, elongated stripes of spores on the leaves. When touched, the spores can be seen on the hands. As soon as symptoms appear, spray a fungicide such as Propiconazole 25% EC at 200 ml per acre or Mancozeb 75% WP at 600-800 g per acre. A second spray may be needed after 15 days if the disease persists."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding irrigation in the Wheat crop","Final Answer":"The timing and amount of irrigation are vital for wheat, and moisture stress at certain growth stages can severely impact the final yield. The critical stages for irrigation are: Crown Root Initiation (CRI) (20-25 days after sowing): This is the most critical stage. Water deficiency at this point can significantly hamper the development of the root system, which affects the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients throughout its life. Tillering Stage (40-45 days after sowing): Proper irrigation during this stage promotes the development of tillers (secondary shoots), which increases the number of productive wheat spikes. Jointing Stage (60-65 days after sowing): This is when the stem elongates. Sufficient water is needed for uninterrupted nutrient uptake and stem development. Flowering Stage (85-90 days after sowing): Moisture stress during flowering can lead to poor pollination and grain formation, directly impacting the final yield. Milk Stage (100-105 days after sowing): At this stage, the grains are filling. Adequate irrigation ensures proper grain size and weight. Surface irrigation is the most traditional and widespread method. It involves flooding the field with water from a channel or a tube well."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended Spacing for Paddy crop by Plant to Plant (PTP) madagascar Method?","Final Answer":"The recommended spacing for paddy within the plant-to-plant (PTP) and SRI framework is 25 centimeters by 25 centimeters. This square pattern is a fundamental aspect of the system. In areas with exceptionally fertile soil, a wider spacing of 30 centimeters by 30 centimeters can be used to allow for even greater plant growth. This specific spacing is critical for several reasons. It significantly reduces competition between individual plants for essential resources like sunlight, nutrients, and water. The ample space allows each plant to develop a large and healthy root system and produce a much higher number of productive tillers. Furthermore, the improved air circulation around the plants helps reduce humidity levels, which lowers the risk of fungal diseases. The wider spacing also enables the use of a mechanical rotary weeder. This tool is essential for controlling weeds while simultaneously aerating the soil, which further promotes strong root development. Although the plant density is lower than in traditional methods, the significantly improved health and productivity of each plant result in a much higher overall yield per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Where can I get Paddy Transplanter?","Final Answer":"Paddy transplanters are available for purchase through authorized agricultural machinery dealers located across major farming districts. Alternatively, farmers can procure these machines through the MP State Agro Industries Development Corporation Ltd. or by applying via official government schemes designed to promote agricultural mechanization. A significant subsidy is available for purchasing a paddy transplanter under the Central Sector Scheme for the promotion of agricultural mechanization. The subsidy rate is set at fifty percent of the machine's cost. This financial support is subject to a ceiling limit of one point two five lakh rupees for a standard four-row paddy transplanter. The subsidy scheme is available to individual farmers, Custom Hiring Centers, and FPOs (Farmer-Producer Organizations). The price of a paddy transplanter varies considerably based on its type and features. A basic manual walk-behind model typically ranges from one point five to two point five lakh rupees. A more advanced four-row riding-type transplanter can cost between 350000 and 650000 rupees. After applying the maximum subsidy, the effective out-of-pocket cost for a four-row machine would be approximately two point seven five lakh rupees for a model priced at four lakh rupees. The area a transplanter can cover depends on its type. A manual walk-behind transplanter operated by a single person can cover approximately zero point three to zero point four acres in a full day. A four-row riding-type machine is significantly more efficient, capable of transplanting two to three acres per day during an eight- to ten-hour operating period. The application process for the subsidy is conducted online through the official MP State Agro Portal. Farmers must first register on the portal using their personal and land details. After registration, they can log in, locate the agricultural mechanization subsidy section, and select the paddy transplanter from the list of available implements. The application requires uploading the necessary documents for verification by district agricultural officers. Once approved, the subsidy amount is transferred directly to the farmer's registered bank account."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to manage in Weed in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"An integrated weed management strategy in rice on an acre basis should combine cultural, mechanical, and chemical measures.\n\n Before sowing, give a pre-sowing irrigation to germinate weed seeds and plough them under. Always raise a healthy, weed-free nursery, destroy leftover nursery patches, clean bunds, and transplant seedlings free of weed contamination at normal spacing of 30\u201336 hills\/m\u00b2 with 30 cm alleys every 2.5\u20133 m in pest- or disease-prone areas. \n\nPractice balanced fertilizer use and alternate wetting and drying to reduce weed and disease incidence, and maintain a thin water film to suppress weeds. In direct-sown rice, sow in lines to facilitate mechanical interweeding at 2\u20133 weeks and again at 4\u20136 weeks if required.\n\n For chemical control, apply cyhalofop-butyl 10% EC @ 0.3 L\/acre at 18\u201320 DAS for grassy weeds, or as pre-emergence use butachlor 50% EC @ 1\u20131.6 L\/acre, pretilachlor 50% EC @ 0.4\u20130.6 L\/acre within 4\u20136 DAT. \n\nFor early post-emergence (3\u201310 DAT), metsulfuron methyl 10% + chlorimuron methyl 10% WP @ 8 g\/acre can be sprayed. Combining these practices ensures effective and sustainable weed control in one acre of rice."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Zinc deficiency in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is mainly grown in the Kharif season. Controlling zinc deficiency in paddy (rice) is essential to prevent 'Khaira Disease,' a condition that causes rusty brown or bronze discolouration of leaves starting from the base, leading to stunted and uneven growth, which significantly reduces yields. The most effective way to manage this deficiency is through soil application of zinc, primarily using Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (ZnSO4\u00b77H2O), which contains 21% elemental zinc. The recommended dose is 8-10 kg per acre, applied as a basal dose before transplanting or within 10 days afterwards, often mixed with sand to ensure even distribution. Soil application of zinc proves better than foliar application.  For quick correction, especially when symptoms of khaira disease appear, foliar sprays of 0.5% zinc sulphate (500 g in 100 litres of water) combined with 250 g of slaked lime to prevent leaf scorch are recommended, starting 10-15 days after transplanting and repeated every 10-15 days as needed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Red termite in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Rainfed rice cultivation - especially with sandy or loamy soils and intermittent moisture - red termites (often called so by local farmers) can severely affect seedlings during drought or water stress. For prevention, begin with field sanitation by removing crop stubble and residues that harbour termite colonies, and implement deep ploughing (two to three passes) to expose subterranean nests to predators like ants and birds. Maintaining field moisture is critical\u2014termites thrive in dry conditions. When infestation is severe, chemical control becomes necessary: use Chlorpyrifos 50% EC as a soil drench at 300\u2013320\u202fml per acre, which offers effective termite suppression in paddy. Alternatively, Fipronil 0.3% GR granules can be applied at 4\u202fkg per acre, either 10-15 days after transplanting or similarly after sowing in direct-seeded fields, providing long-lasting protection."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Bacterial Blight in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) is a damaging rice disease that causes yellowing and drying of leaves, leading to significant yield loss. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and worsens when seedlings are injured during transplanting or when excess nitrogen fertilizer is applied. To manage BLB, farmers should use resistant varieties and treat seeds properly using safe methods such as hot water treatment or biological seed treatments like Trichoderma viride (4 g\/kg of seed) or Pseudomonas fluorescens (10 g\/kg of seed), which help suppress the pathogen naturally. Maintaining good field sanitation, balanced split nitrogen fertilization, and proper water management to avoid stagnant water are essential cultural practices. Chemical control should avoid banned antibiotics like streptomycin and tetracycline; instead, copper-based bactericides such as copper oxychloride at 600\u2013800 grams per acre diluted in 200 litres of water can be sprayed safely at early symptom stages. Additionally, avoiding seedling injury and ensuring proper plant spacing help reduce disease severity, making integrated management vital for healthy and high-yielding paddy crops."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Gundhi bug in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Gundhi bug, also called the Rice Stink Bug or Rice Seed Bug (Leptocorisa acuta), is a significant pest of paddy crops. Both nymphs and adults suck sap from individual grains during the milky stage, causing the grains to become chaffy and develop black spots at feeding sites. A characteristic buggy odour is often noticeable in the rice field during this stage. The eggs are circular, brownish, about 2 mm long, and laid in clusters along the midrib of the leaf. Nymphs start pale green and grow darker with each stage, while adults are greenish-yellow, slender, and about half an inch long. Effective management involves monitoring the economic threshold level (ETL), which is 5 bugs per 100 earheads at flowering and 16 bugs per 100 earheads from the milky stage to maturity. Control measures include dusting insecticides such as Quinalphos 1.5 D or KKM 10 D  at 10 kg per acre twice, once at flowering and again a week later. Spraying Malathion 50 EC at 200 ml per acre or applying neem seed kernel extract (5%) and leaf extracts of Notchi, Ipomoea, are also effective options."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Fungal diseases in Paddy?","Final Answer":"To control fungal diseases in paddy, an integrated approach involving cultural, preventive, and chemical methods is essential. Use certified, disease-free seeds and treat them with fungicides like Carbendazim, Thiram, or Captan at 2 g\/kg seed before sowing. Good field sanitation - removing and destroying infected debris, straw, and stubble - helps reduce disease sources. Avoid excessive nitrogen application; use split doses to minimize disease risk. Proper plant spacing and good drainage reduce humidity, limiting fungal growth. Regular monitoring during critical growth stages, especially from tillering to flowering, is necessary for early detection. If fungal disease symptoms appear, use specific fungicides at recommended doses per acre for effective control. Blast disease for brown spot: Copper oxychloride at 500-600 grams per acre. For false smut, you may use propiconazole at 400\u2013600 ml per acre. Avoid applying fungicides without specifying the disease and dose, as this may cause ineffective control or resistance. Using integrated disease management with clear fungicide recommendations ensures healthier paddy crops and reduces yield losses from fungal infections."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control stem borer in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Stem borer is a major pest of rice that causes serious yield losses. They typically attack at the bud stage, where larvae bore into the central shoot, leading to drying of the central whorl - a condition known as \u201cdead heart.\u201d In older plants, the damage appears as dried panicles, referred to as \u201cwhite ear.\u201d Early symptoms include the presence of brown egg masses near the leaf tips, and infested shoots or panicles can be easily pulled out. The larvae are pale yellow with dark brown heads, while adult moths differ in colouration and markings by species. Effective management begins with cultural practices such as clipping seedling tips before transplanting to remove eggs and installing light traps (1\/ac) and pheromone traps (5\/ac) to monitor and reduce adult populations. For biological control, release the egg parasitoid Trichogramma japonicum @ 2 cc\/acre at weekly intervals. Botanical options include Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE) 5% or Azadirachtin 0.03% @ 400 ml\/acre, which help suppress early infestations. When pest levels exceed the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) - 10% dead heart or 2% white ear symptoms \u2014 chemical control is recommended. Safer and effective insecticides include Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml\/acre (PHI: 47 days), Flubendiamide 20% WG @ 50 g\/acre (PHI: 30-40 days), Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 40 g\/acre (PHI: 21 days).

Delayed sowing beyond this period may lead to reduced yields. The variety typically matures in about 110 to 120 days and requires a seed rate of around 45 to 50 kilograms per acre. Proper irrigation should be provided as needed to ensure healthy crop development. Following these guidelines helps in achieving good productivity and quality grain from the LOK-1 wheat variety."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the weeds in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Weed control in wheat is crucial, as weeds can cause a yield reduction of 25\u201335%, depending on their density and competition with the main crop for resources like nutrients, water, light, and space. In wheat, weeds are mainly categorized into broad-leaved (e.g., Bathua, Senji, Chicory, Wild Spinach, Akari, Wild Pea) and narrow-leaved or grassy weeds (e.g., Motha, Kansa, Wild Oats, Bird Millet). Among the available control methods, the chemical method (herbicides) is widely preferred due to its time efficiency and effectiveness. Chemical control involves Pendimethalin (405 g\/acre)\u2014applied immediately after sowing for both broad- and narrow-leaved weeds\u2014or Sulfosulfuron (13.6 g\/acre)\u2014applied within 35 days after sowing\u2014or Metribuzin (101 g\/acre)\u2014applied within 35 days after sowing\u2014or 2,4-D (162\u2013202 g\/acre)\u2014for broad-leaved weeds, applied within 35 days\u2014or Isoproturon (303 g\/acre)\u2014for grassy weeds, applied within 20 days of sowing\u2014or Isoproturon + 2,4-D (303 g + 303 g\/acre)\u2014for targeting both broad- and narrow-leaved weeds. Adopting timely and appropriate herbicide application ensures effective weed suppression and optimal crop performance in wheat fields."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the side effects of Whip Super spray on wheat?","Final Answer":"Whip Super is a selective post-emergence herbicide targeting grassy weeds (e.g., Echinochloa, Digitaria) and is not labeled or recommended for use in wheat. Its approved uses include crops like soybean, rice, cotton, black gram, onion, and groundnut. Consequently, using Whip Super on wheat constitutes off-label use, which carries risks due to lack of official safety or efficacy data for that crop. General herbicide injury symptoms in wheat (from other herbicide groups) include leaf tip chlorosis, wilting, necrotic lesions, stunting, and death\u2014often due to misapplication, drift, tank contamination, or carryover effects. Applying a non-approved herbicide like Whip Super on wheat could potentially lead to similar injury symptoms, but no direct studies or documented evidence currently exist."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the sowing time of Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"The field should be prepared with summer tillage and deep plowing once every three years, followed by harrowing or use of a rotavator to achieve fine tilth. Sowing time varies with irrigation: in non-irrigated fields, sow from mid-October to the first week of November; in semi-irrigated conditions, sow in the first fortnight of November; for timely irrigated sowing, sow in the second fortnight of November; and for delayed irrigated sowing, begin in the second week of December. The seed rate is about 40 kg per acre for timely sown varieties, and 50 kg per acre for late-sown varieties. Maintain a spacing of 25 cm row-to-row in non- or semi-irrigated fields and 23 cm in irrigated timely sowing. Seeds should never be mixed with fertilizer while sowing (as this reduces germination by 32%); instead, use a seed-cum-fertilizer drill. Treat seeds with Carboxin 75% WP or Carbendazim 50% WP at 2.5\u20133 g\/kg seed, or Tebuconazole at 1 g\/kg for protection against diseases like Karnal bunt, and apply PSB culture at 5 g\/kg seed to enhance phosphorus availability."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to manage Tip burning symptoms in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Tip burning in wheat is caused by potassium deficiency, frost, or salinity. To control it, apply a foliar spray of potassium nitrate (KNO\u2083) at 1\u20132% concentration (2 kg in 200 L water). Along with this, apply a balanced nutrient application under fully irrigated conditions: 50 kg urea (23 kg N), 370 kg SSP (60 kg P\u2082O\u2085), and 50 kg MOP (30 kg K\u2082O) per acre. Apply zinc sulphate @ 10 kg\/acre once every three crops to correct widespread micronutrient deficiencies.\n\nSplit nitrogen applications are advised: half as basal at sowing and half as top dressing at crown root initiation (CRI) stage (20\u201325 days after sowing). Maintain regular and sufficient soil moisture, especially during hot or windy periods. Mulching with crop residues or organic material helps reduce moisture loss.\n\nTo protect against frost, adjust sowing dates and apply light irrigation before a predicted frost night; this raises soil temperature and reduces frost intensity in the crop canopy. Tip burn caused by salinity can be managed by using good-quality irrigation water, applying gypsum in sodic soils as per soil test, and improving drainage in waterlogged areas."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can irrigation be given  to Wheat during milking stage?","Final Answer":"Irrigation is crucial for higher grain yield; sprinkler irrigation is preferable for uniform moisture. Unlike older varieties needing 5\u20136 irrigations, improved varieties developed by universities perform well with 3\u20134 irrigations, giving about 20-25 quintals\/acre for Wheat.\n\nThe most critical stage for irrigation is during the crown root initiation stage, which is around 20-25 days after sowing. The second irrigation should be given at the Boot stage (80-85 DAS), and the third irrigation should be given during the Milking stage (95-105 DAS). The irrigation schedule can vary based on the type of soil and the moisture retention capacity of the soil."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I give irrigation at milking stage of Wheat?","Final Answer":"Irrigating wheat during the milking stage is a crucial practice for maximizing yield and grain quality. This stage, also known as the milk-dough stage or grain-filling stage, occurs when the kernels in the wheat head begin to fill with a milky-white liquid. The milking stage is one of the most critical growth stages for wheat. During this period, the plant is at its peak requirement for water. A lack of moisture during this time can severely impact the final yield. Water is essential for the proper development and filling of the grains. Inadequate water can lead to shrunken, shriveled, and lighter grains, significantly reducing the final yield and market value. Proper soil moisture ensures that the plant can efficiently absorb and transport nutrients from the soil to the developing grains. The milking stage typically occurs 100-105 days after sowing (DAS). It is often the fifth irrigation in a standard irrigation schedule for wheat in the region. The exact timing can vary slightly depending on the wheat variety, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions. The amount of water required for irrigation at the milking stage and for the entire crop duration can vary. A typical irrigation depth is 6-8 cm. The actual amount to be applied depends on soil moisture levels. A good practice is to irrigate when the soil appears dry and the plant shows signs of stress."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control bacterial blight in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Controlling bacterial blight in paddy requires an integrated approach that combines cultural practices, resistant varieties, and chemical control. The disease, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, thrives in warm, humid conditions and is a major threat to rice cultivation. : Planting resistant or moderately resistant varieties is the most effective way to prevent the disease. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer application, as this can make the plants more susceptible to the disease. Apply nitrogen in split doses to maintain a balanced nutrient profile. Remove and destroy weed hosts and crop residues. Avoid clipping of seedlings during transplanting, as this creates entry points for the bacteria. Drain the field to reduce moisture and spread, especially during the kresek (wilting) stage of the disease. When the disease appears, chemical control measures are necessary to prevent further spread. Dosage is often a combination of an antibiotic and a copper-based bactericide. Kasugamycin @ 400-600 mL per acre, mixed with about 200-300 liters of water, Copper Oxychloride (COC) @ 500 grams per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which fertilizer should be applied to paddy?","Final Answer":"A balanced application of fertilizers is crucial for a high-yielding paddy (rice) crop. The fertilizer schedule is typically divided into a basal application (at the time of transplanting) and one or two top dressings. Soil testing must be done to determine the quantity of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash based on the test. The general recommendation for NPK fertilizer for paddy in Madhya Pradesh, where both high-yielding varieties and hybrids are grown, is Nitrogen: 40-50 kg per acre, Phosphorus: 24-28 kg per acre, Potassium: 16-24 kg per acre. Apply the full dose of Phosphorus and Potassium, and a third of the Nitrogen. You can achieve these grades by using approximately 50-60 kg of DAP per acre; you will need approximately 25-30 kg of MOP per acre. The remaining two-thirds of the Nitrogen (N) should be applied in two split doses to ensure a continuous supply throughout the crop's life cycle. Apply approximately 40-45 kg of Urea per acre at around 20-25 days after transplanting (DAT), at the tillering stage. Apply another 40-45 kg of Urea per acre at 40-45 DAT, at the panicle initiation stage. For zinc-deficient soils, which are common in Madhya Pradesh, apply 10 kg of Zinc sulfate per acre as a basal dose. Applying 4-6 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM per acre during land preparation is highly recommended to improve soil health and fertility."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Leaf folder in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Leaf folder is a major pest of paddy where larvae fold the leaves and feed within, causing white streaks and reduced photosynthesis. Management requires an integrated approach. Start with cultural practices like using resistant varieties, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilizer, and maintaining proper field sanitation. Encourage biological control by conserving natural enemies like spiders and Trichogramma wasps. For chemical control, apply insecticides only when the pest population exceeds the economic threshold level of 10% damaged leaves. Recommended insecticides include chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % SC at 40 ml\/acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. The waiting period between application and harvest is 40-47 days. Another effective chemical is flubendiamide 20% WG at 40-60 gm\/acre, which requires a 30-40 day interval period. Apply when leaf folding is first observed, with a second application if needed after 12-15 days. Always follow manufacturer instructions and avoid using banned chemicals like monocrotophos."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control sucking pests in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Zaid season is not suitable for paddy cultivation due to limited water availability and high temperatures; if you want to grow paddy, it should be cultivated in the kharif season when adequate rainfall and favourable climatic conditions are available. Sucking pests, such as brown planthoppers, green leafhoppers, and thrips, can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and even \"hopper burn\" (scorched appearance). They can also transmit diseases like rice tungro virus. To control them, an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical measures is recommended. Avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertiliser. Keep the field and surrounding bunds clean by removing weeds and volunteer plants. Plant rice all at once in a region within a short window (up to 3 weeks) to break pest life cycles and reduce buildup. Avoid close planting to allow for better air circulation, which can reduce pest pressure. For upland rice, practising intercropping with plants like soybean can help reduce the incidence of leafhoppers. Drain fields for 3-4 days during early pest attack, disrupting breeding of planthoppers. Conserve and encourage natural enemies, such as lacewings, ladybird beetles, predatory wasps, and spiders, and apply a foliar spray of neem oil at 2-5 ml per litre of water or 5% neem seed kernel extract. In case of heavy infestation, apply a chemical insecticide. The recommended insecticides for controlling sucking pests in rice are: Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water(PHI 40 days) or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 grams per acre in 200 litres of water(PHI 21 days) or Buprofezin 25 SC @ 320-400 ml per acre in 160-200 litres of water(PHI 21 days). Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Leaf Blight in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Leaf blight in paddy (rice) is a serious bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. It can cause significant yield losses and is particularly damaging in warm, humid conditions with strong winds and heavy rainfall. Leaf blight symptoms start as water-soaked streaks on leaf edges, which turn yellow, then brown, and dry out, causing lesions and reducing photosynthetic area and crop yield. To control this, an integrated disease management approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical measures is recommended. Use disease free-certified seeds, select bacterial leaf blight resistant variety suitable for your location such as CR Dhan 802 (Subhas), Jayantidhan (CR Dhan 503), Bhupesh (IET 23324), avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer, drain the field to a dry condition when the disease is observed, and keep it dry for a few days to suppress the bacteria. Maintain proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation. In case of severe infection, spray Copper Oxychloride 50 WP @ 600 grams per acre in 200 litres of water or Trifloxystrobin + Tebuconazole @ 250 grams per acre in 200 litres of water. Regularly monitor your paddy field for initial symptoms, such as water-soaked lesions and yellowish streaks on the leaves, and rotate different active ingredients to prevent the pathogen from developing resistance."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Leaf Roller in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy grows best in the kharif season under warm and humid conditions, whereas the zaid season is not suitable because of high temperatures, low rainfall, and limited water availability for irrigation. Leaf roller is a common insect pest in paddy that causes serious damage to the crop. The caterpillars roll the leaves and feed inside, which prevents normal photosynthesis. The typical symptom is that the leaves appear rolled, folded, and dry from the inside, and the crop looks pale with reduced tillering and poor grain filling. To control this, an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical measures is recommended. Avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer, maintain proper spacing (22.5 x 20 cm and 30 x 20 cm), keep the field and surrounding bunds free from weeds, and remove the causes of shedding in the field. Install light traps @ 6-8 per acre to monitor and kill the pests, conserve natural predators such as spiders, wasps (parasitoids), and ladybird beetles. When the infestation is severe, spray neem-based insecticides such as azadirachtin 0.03% EC (300 ppm) at 2.5-3 ml per litre of water or neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) 5% to reduce larval population. Chemical control should be a last resort and used only when the pest population exceeds the Economic Threshold Level (ETL), which is typically one to two larvae per plant in the early stages of the crop. The recommended insecticides are: Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water or Flubendiamide 20% WG @ 40-50 grams per acre in 200 litres of water. The best time to spray is during the larval stage, before the caterpillars have folded the leaves."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"At which stage does fruit setting occur in Paddy and how to improve?","Final Answer":"Paddy grows best in the kharif season under warm and humid conditions, whereas the zaid season is not suitable because of high temperatures, low rainfall, and limited water availability for irrigation. Fruit setting in paddy occurs during the reproductive phase, specifically after flowering. After the flowering stage, which starts when the panicle (rice head) emerges from the boot leaf and spikelets open for pollination, fertilization takes place, leading to grain formation or fruit setting. This stage is known as the grain development or fruit setting stage, which immediately follows flowering and lasts for several days as the ovules develop into grains. To improve fruit setting in paddy, proper water management should be followed, keeping the field moist but not waterlogged during flowering. Adequate nutrition is essential, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, along with micronutrients like zinc and boron, which play a key role in panicle development and grain filling. Timely application of fertilizers and foliar sprays at the panicle initiation and flowering stage helps in improving setting. Pest and disease control is also crucial, as insects like stem borer and diseases like blast can reduce flowering and grain formation. Favourable climatic conditions, particularly avoiding moisture stress and high temperature during flowering, support better pollination and fertilization."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Blast disease in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Blast disease in paddy (rice) is a very serious problem, as it causes leaf spots and neck and panicle infection, which dries plants and reduces yield, especially in high humidity and excess nitrogen conditions. To manage blast well, always grow blast-resistant varieties suitable for Madhya Pradesh, like IR-64, IR-36, Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa Sugandha-5, Pusa Sugandha-4, MTU-1010, and NDR-97, which give good protection against the disease. Apply fertilisers in a balanced way, giving nitrogen in split doses and adding potash to strengthen the plants. Maintain proper plant spacing for good air circulation and avoid too much humidity in the field. Keep a close eye on the field regularly, especially from nursery to panicle initiation, as this is the most dangerous time for blast. If you see symptoms like diamond-shaped spots with grey centres on leaves or blackened panicle neck, immediately spray Isoprothiolane 40 EC at 300 ml\/acre in 200 litres of water. Alternatively, you can use Hexaconazole 5 EC at 400 ml\/acre in 200 litres of water, repeating after 10\u201312 days if needed. Also, you can use Carbendazim 50% WP (200 g\/acre) in 200-250 litres of water (but always apply it under expert guidance, as it has some restrictions). To avoid disease buildup, do not over-irrigate and always destroy diseased plant residues and weeds on bunds after harvest. Keep a continuous water layer of 2\u20134 inches from tillering to harvest to reduce blast risk. The best time to spray fungicide is during the late boot stage and at 50% heading to stop neck blast, which causes most yield loss. Maintain proper Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI): Carbendazim \u2013 15\u201320 days, Isoprothiolane \u2013 60 days, Hexaconazole \u2013 40 days. Always spray fungicides only when needed and never near harvest time to keep grain safe for use. By following these good practices carefully, you can protect your paddy from blast disease and get a healthy, high-yield crop."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control leaf rot in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy shows several diseases, like leaf rot, which is commonly known as sheath rot, a serious problem in paddy crops. Sheath rot is caused by the fungus Sarocladium oryzae and generally affects rice from late tillering to maturity, especially in fields with standing water and excessive nitrogen use. Symptoms include grey to brown lesions on the upper leaf sheath (that encloses the flowering panicle), white powdery fungal growth inside the sheath, incomplete panicle emergence, and shrivelled or sterile grains. Affected sheaths may rot, and panicles often fail to fully emerge, resulting in poor grain filling and yield losses. To stop it, first you can follow crop rotation with wheat or maize, don\u2019t overuse urea, and keep proper water management\u2014if you see infection, drain water for 4\u20135 days. Use recommended tolerant varieties like NDR 359, Jaya, MTU 7029, Swarna Sub-1, and Sahbhagi Dhan for better safety. For chemical control, you can foliar spray Validamycin 3% L @ 400 ml per acre or Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml in 200 litres of water per acre with a knapsack or power sprayer. As an alternative, you can use Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml\/acre\u2014it also works well and is safe for paddy. Start the spray whenever you can see the first symptom. Make sure you cover the base of the tillers where the rot starts, keep a 10\u201312 day gap between sprays if a repeat is needed, and you should maintain a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of at least 14 days for Validamycin 3% L, 15 days for Propiconazole 25% EC, and 14\u201315 days for Hexaconazole 5% EC to ensure no chemical residue remains in the grains or straw before harvest. For eco-friendly and residue-free management, apply Trichoderma harzianum formulation @ 1 kg\/acre mixed with 50 kg well-decomposed FYM or vermicompost and broadcast in the field at puddling or transplanting. This beneficial fungus competes with the leaf rot pathogen and reduces its survival in soil, giving long-term protection. Repeat once mid-season if field history shows high disease pressure. After harvest, remove and burn badly infected clumps so the fungus doesn\u2019t survive in the next crop. By using these combined steps, you can control rot disease in paddy."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Gundhi Bug in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the Kharif season because it requires warm temperatures (25\u201335\u00b0C), high humidity and plenty of water for proper growth. The Zaid season is hot and dry with limited water availability, which is unsuitable for paddy cultivation, so it cannot grow well during this period. Gundhi bug in Paddy sucks sap from grains at the milky stage, causing empty or chaffy grains. Heavy infestation can significantly reduce yield and grain quality. To control the pest, spray insecticide like Imidacloprid 6 + Lambda-cyhalothrin 4 SL at 120 ml\/acre. Always follow the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) and before doing the harvesting of Paddy, wait for 10 days after using Imidacloprid 6 + Lambda-cyhalothrin 4 SL."}

It is always advisable to use certified seeds from authorized sources and implement integrated crop management practices for optimal results."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the yellowing leaves of Wheat?","Final Answer":"The yellowing of wheat is a widespread concern that can significantly reduce yield. This is not a single disease but a symptom caused by a variety of factors, such as Nutrient deficiencies of Nitrogen, Zinc, Potassium, and Sulfur. This is one of the most common causes. Or due to waterlogging, moisture stress, and frost injury. Or it can happen due to fungal or bacterial diseases such as Leaf Blight (Spot Blotch), Leaf Rust. The timing of the symptom provides a major clue to the cause: Early Stages (Tillering to Stem Elongation): Typically points to nutrient deficiencies (N, Zn), waterlogging, or root rot. Heading Stage (Booting): Often caused by moisture stress or severe leaf blight. To control yellowing of wheat, you need to test the soil every 2-3 years and apply fertilizers based on the recommendation to avoid deficiencies. This is the most important step. Choose varieties that are resistant\/tolerant to rusts and blights, such as JW 3020, JW 3173, JW 3211, HI 1620, and MP 3336. Complete sowing between November 10th and 25th. Late sowing exposes the crop to higher temperatures during grain filling, causing forced maturity. Apply balanced fertilizers and provide adequate irrigation. For Nutrient Deficiencies: For N deficiency, top-dress with urea and irrigate. For Zn deficiency, foliar spray with 0.5% Zinc Sulphate (5g per liter of water) + a few drops of sticking agent. For Fungal Diseases (Leaf Blight, Rust): Propiconazole 25% EC @ 0.1% (200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water), Tebuconazole 25.9% EC @ 0.1% (200 ml per acre in 200 liters of water).

A pre-harvest interval of 7 days is needed for imidacloprid and 10 days for thiamethoxam 25 WG to avoid contamination. Ensure seedlings are well hardened before transplanting, and avoid excessive nitrogen application to further reduce gondola incidence, while observing a 30-day pre-harvest interval for all pesticide treatments."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much Irrigation is required for a Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Wheat is a major rabi season crop, in which efficient irrigation management is crucial for achieving optimal yield. The total water requirement for wheat is typically between 400 and 500 mm, with the number of irrigations and their timing being more critical than the total volume. The first and most critical irrigation is the crown root initiation (CRI) stage, which occurs about 20-25 days after sowing. This irrigation is essential for proper root development and tillering. Subsequent irrigations should be applied at key growth stages to avoid moisture stress. These critical stages include the tillering stage (40-45 days after sowing), the late jointing stage, flag leaf emergence, booting, flowering, and the milk\/dough stage of grain development. The number of irrigations can vary from 4 to 6, depending on soil type, with light soils requiring more frequent applications than heavier clay soils. It is important to avoid waterlogging and to ensure that irrigation is stopped well before harvest to allow for proper field drying. The use of water-efficient methods like sprinklers or drip irrigation is highly encouraged to conserve water."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage Bacterial diseases in Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Controlling bacterial diseases in paddy, such as Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) and Bacterial Leaf Streak (BLS), requires an integrated management strategy, as these diseases can cause significant yield loss under favourable warm and humid conditions. The foundation of control is prevention, starting with the use of certified seeds of resistant or tolerant varieties recommended for the region. Practising good field sanitation is crucial; this includes removing and destroying infected crop residues and weed hosts to eliminate sources of inoculum. Avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization is important, as high nitrogen levels increase plant susceptibility. Ensuring proper water management by adopting intermittent irrigation to avoid prolonged flooding and preventing water movement from infected fields to healthy ones can significantly reduce disease spread. For chemical control, copper-based bactericides are the primary option. A recommended application is Copper Oxychloride 50% WP at a rate of 1 to 1.5 gm\/liter of water, which translates to approximately 500-600 gm\/acre when applied in a spray volume of 400 liters. Applications should be initiated at the first appearance of disease symptoms and repeated at intervals of 10-15 days, depending on disease severity and weather conditions. Thorough coverage of the foliage is essential for effectiveness. It is critical to strictly avoid the use of banned antibiotics like streptocycline. Farmers must always adhere to the recommended dosage, wear protective gear during application, and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) stated on the product label."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Mustard (weed) in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"Controlling mustard as a weed in wheat crops requires a combination of cultural practices and careful chemical use. Mustard can compete aggressively with wheat for nutrients, water, and light, potentially reducing yields if not managed properly. Preventive measures are the first line of defence. These include using certified, weed-free wheat seeds to avoid introducing mustard seeds into the field. Practicing crop rotation with non-host crops like pulses or legumes can help break the weed cycle. Ensuring clean farm machinery and tools to prevent the spread of weed seeds from infested areas is also important. Early manual removal of mustard weeds before they set seeds can significantly reduce future infestations. For chemical control, selective herbicides that target broadleaf weeds without harming wheat are recommended. A commonly used herbicide is 2,4-D Ethyl Ester 38% EC, applied at a rate of 300-400 ml\/acre, mixed in 150-200 liters of water. This should be sprayed during the active growth stage of the weeds, typically when mustard is at the 3-5 leaf stage and wheat is in the tillering stage, usually 30-35 days after sowing. Another effective option is Metsulfuron Methyl 20% WP, used at 8-10 grams\/acre, dissolved in 200 liters of water. Application timing is critical, and it should be done during the early growth stages of the weeds. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Avoid using banned chemicals and adhere to the pre-harvest interval specified on the label. Integrating chemical methods with cultural practices enhances long-term control. Maintaining proper wheat density through recommended seed rates can help suppress weed growth by shading them out. Always take advice from an agri expert."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which tonic should I use in Wheat?","Final Answer":"In wheat farming, a \"tonic\" typically refers to a plant growth regulator (PGR) or a micronutrient mix that boosts the plant's health and yield. The choice of tonic depends on the crop's growth stage and the specific deficiency being addressed. Commonly recommended tonics include humic acid and seaweed extracts, which stimulate root growth and improve nutrient uptake. They are particularly useful during the early vegetative stage. Tonics increase the root system's size, helping the plant access more nutrients and water from the soil. They can be applied as foliar sprays or soil drenches. Zinc and iron deficiencies are common in wheat. Zinc deficiency leads to stunted growth and a reddish-brown discoloration of the leaves. Iron deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves while the veins remain green). To manage these deficiencies, foliar sprays of 0.5% zinc sulphate solution (5 grams zinc sulphate + 2.5 grams lime in 1 litre of water) and 0.5% ferrous sulphate solution (5 grams ferrous sulphate + 2.5 grams lime in 1 litre of water) are very effective. Plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as gibberellic acid promote tillering (the formation of new shoots from the base of the plant), which increases the number of grain-bearing heads. Chlormequat chloride can be used to shorten the plant's height and strengthen the stem, making it less susceptible to lodging (bending or falling over due to wind or rain)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can we delay the third Irrigation in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Yes, you can delay the third irrigation in wheat, but it depends on a few critical factors, primarily soil type and recent rainfall. The third irrigation is usually applied at the flowering (heading) or milk stage, which is crucial for grain development. Water stress at this stage can severely reduce grain weight and yield. If your field has received good post-sowing rainfall or proper irrigation during the first two stages, the third irrigation can be delayed. In regions with lighter soils, which have poor water retention, delaying the third irrigation is risky and not advisable, as it may reduce tiller formation and affect yield. If the region receives good winter rainfall (from December to February), the third irrigation can also be delayed. The rain will replenish soil moisture, and an extra irrigation might not be needed."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Where can I get breeder seeds for Wheat?","Final Answer":"You can obtain breeder seeds of wheat from Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (JNKVV), and its Zonal Agricultural Research Station, Powarkheda, Hoshangabad, or through the National Seeds Corporation (NSC) unit. Additionally, you can contact Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Hoshangabad; they can assist with information and procurement of breeder seeds for wheat."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which is the most important time for irrigation in Wheat?","Final Answer":"Wheat is grown in the Rabi season because it needs cool weather for growth and dry conditions at harvest. In Kharif, heavy rains and high temperatures cause poor germination, pests, and weak grain quality. The most important time for irrigation in wheat is at the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage, which comes about 20\u201325 days after sowing. At this stage, the roots start developing, and if the crop does not get water, tillering is badly affected and yield is reduced. Although wheat may need 4\u20135 irrigations in total depending on soil and climate, the CRI stage is considered the critical stage where irrigation is most essential for good growth and high yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I sow Wheat after harvesting Pea?","Final Answer":"Wheat is grown in the Rabi season because it needs cool weather for growth and dry conditions at harvest. In Kharif, heavy rains and high temperatures cause poor germination, pests, and weak grain quality. Yes, you can sow wheat after harvesting peas, as peas are a legume crop that enriches the soil with nitrogen and improves fertility. This helps the wheat crop grow better. But you should prepare the field properly after the pea harvest by doing light tillage, conserving soil moisture, and sowing wheat at the right time so that the crop is not delayed. This crop rotation is good for both soil health and yield. In general, peas are sown after the harvest of Kharif crops. The most common rotations are Maize \u2013 Pea; Paddy \u2013 Pea \u2013 Wheat (being popular in Northern India); Cotton \u2013 Pea; Jowar \u2013 Pea; and Bajra \u2013 Pea."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control soil insects in Wheat crop?","Final Answer":"The most common soil insects that affect wheat are termites and cutworms. Termites feed on roots and underground plant parts, especially in unirrigated areas. Cutworm larvae feed on seedlings by cutting them at or just below the soil surface. To control these pests, an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical measures is recommended. To control termites: Plough the field deeply during summer, repeating at 10-day intervals. Remove volunteer wheat and alternate host plants at least two weeks before planting to break pest life cycles. Apply well-rotted farmyard manure, and avoid using fresh cow dung or manure before sowing. Avoid late sowing of crops. Use crude oil emulsion to destroy termite colonies. Place 4 earthen pots per acre with 500 untreated maize grains, or in 10 locations in the wheat field, apply 1 kg of raw cow dung."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"When is Wheat purchased at MSP in the mandi?","Final Answer":"Based on recent years' procurement schedules, the wheat marketing season generally runs from mid-March to early May. For the 2025 season, the official procurement period was fixed from March 15 to May 5. During this time, wheat is procured at \u20b92,600 per quintal, which includes the MSP of \u20b92,425 plus an additional state bonus of \u20b9175 per quintal. Farmers must register online beforehand through the state's e-Uparjan portal to be eligible for selling their produce at MSP. This registration usually takes place in January and February, well before procurement begins."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the seed rate of Wheat?","Final Answer":"The recommended seed rate for wheat is about 40\u202fkg per acre when the thousand-grain weight is up to 40\u202fg, and for every 1\u202fg increase in thousand-grain weight above this, the seed rate should be increased by 1\u202fkg per acre. In irrigated and timely-sown conditions, row spacing should be 23\u202fcm, while under non-irrigated or semi-irrigated conditions, a spacing of 25\u202fcm is suggested. It is specifically advised not to mix seed with fertilizer, as doing so can reduce germination by approximately 32%."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommanded scented varieties of paddy?","Final Answer":"While aromatic rice cultivation is predominantly associated with the Kharif (monsoon) season, some varieties are suitable for the Zaid season due to their shorter growth duration and adaptability. While traditionally grown in Basmati-producing regions, several aromatic varieties are well-suited for the soil and climate of other regions as well. These scented varieties are known for their distinct aroma, long grains, and superior cooking quality. Yields can vary based on the specific variety, farming practices, and soil fertility. Pusa Basmati 1121: This is a very popular and high-yielding Basmati variety that has gained wide acceptance across India. It is a semi-dwarf, high-yielding variety with a maturity period of 135\u2013145 days and typically yields 16-20 quintals per acre. Pusa Basmati 1509: Known for its shorter duration and higher yield, this is an early-maturing variety with a seed-to-seed maturity of just 115-120 days. Its early maturity saves water and provides a longer window for preparing the field for the next crop. It can yield 20-24 quintals per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why is paddy seed treatment necessary?","Final Answer":"Paddy is a kharif season crop. Paddy seed treatment is an important practice to ensure healthy crop establishment and better yield. It involves treating seeds with fungicides, insecticides, or bio-agents before sowing or nursery raising. Paddy seeds can carry fungi like Bipolaris oryzae, Fusarium spp., and Rhizoctonia solani, or bacteria. Seed treatment prevents damping-off, seed rot, and early blight, ensuring higher germination. Treated seeds reduce losses from root rot, foot rot, and blast at the seedling stage. Treated seeds absorb water better and germinate uniformly, leading to stronger, more vigorous seedlings that can withstand stress. Certain insecticides used in seed treatment protect seedlings from pests like stem borers, leaf folders, or nematodes. Healthy seedlings establish quickly in the field, giving a uniform crop and reducing replanting costs, and minimizing gaps in the field."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can DAP be applied mixed with paddy seeds?","Final Answer":"No, DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate) should not be directly mixed with paddy seeds before sowing. Applying DAP directly to seeds can cause chemical injury, reducing germination and seedling vigor. Instead, DAP should be applied to the soil as a basal dose before sowing to provide essential nutrients to the crop. However, nano DAP, a liquid formulation of DAP, can be used for seed treatment. According to research, treating seeds with nano DAP at a concentration of 5 ml per kg of seeds has been shown to improve germination, seedling growth, and overall crop yield. For DAP: Apply as a basal dose to the soil before sowing to avoid direct contact with seeds."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"After removing extra suckers, how many saplings should be kept with the Banana mother plant?","Final Answer":"After flowering,  keep only 1 healthy sucker (daughter plant) of the mother banana plant. Remove all extra suckers every 45\u201360 days. This helps to reduce competition, avoid overcrowding, save nutrients and water, and gives better fruit yield. If more suckers are kept, plants compete for water and nutrients, which reduces fruit size and quality. Keeping one strong sucker ensures a good yield in the next season. Select the sucker that is close to the main plant, upright, and has a pointed leaf (sword type). Avoid water-filled suckers or those with broad leaves (water suckers), as they are weak and reduce yield. Use a clean sickle for sucker removal and dip it in bleaching powder solution (20 grams per litre of water) before and after cutting to prevent disease. After removal, apply Carbendazim 50% WP @ 200 grams per acre in 200 litres of water near the base to prevent fungal rot. As Carbendazim 50% WP is under some restriction in that case, you can also use as alternatively Glyphosate 41% SL at 2 ml per litre of water directly on the sucker\u2019s cut surface to avoid main plant injury. As a rotation, you can also use Copper Oxychloride 50% WP @ 500 grams per acre in 200 litres of water. For organic farmers, mix Trichoderma viride @ 1 kg with 25 kg compost per acre and apply near the base, or you can apply common salt or kerosene on the cut part to dry it out, but it can be less effective if you only use it. Always use gloves and avoid spraying on the main plant. This practice helps the main plant grow better, gives a healthy ratoon crop, gives more yield, and good profit. For any subsidy or loan help, visit your local Horticulture Office and carry these documents: Aadhaar card, land proof (ROR), recent passport-size photo, and bank passbook copy."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide guidelines on cultivation and management of Arecanut?","Final Answer":" Arecanut farming can give good production if done properly with right variety, spacing, and care. farmers can grow arecanut in areas with good rainfall and well-drained loamy soil. You can go for high-yielding varieties like Mangala, Sumangala, and Mohitnagar \u2014 these give good quality nuts and perform well in this region. Apply compost or FYM @ 10\u201315 kg per pit before planting and keep the field weed-free in early months. While planting, keep a spacing of 2.7 meter by 2.7 meter. This helps the palm grow properly and gives about 1,370 plants per hectare. Dig pits of 60 cm \u00d7 60 cm \u00d7 60 cm, fill them with compost and topsoil, and plant during May to July, just before monsoon. Each mature arecanut plant needs 100 gram Nitrogen, 40 gram Phosphorus, and 140 gram Potassium per year. You can apply it in two splits \u2013 once before monsoon (May\u2013June, ) and second in (September\u2013October). Also you can add neem cake (500 gram per plant) once a year to improve soil and reduce pests. For spindle bug, use Dimethoate 30% EC 1.5 ml of Dimethoate in 1 liter of water as a drenching spray into the leaf axils and crown of the arecanut palm, apply Dimethoate carefully and ensure a Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of at least 7 days is followed as per label instructions to avoid residue issues. For mites you can spray Wettable Sulphur (usually 80% WP or 90% WDG formulation) Mix 2.5-3.0 grams of Wettable Sulphur in 1 liter of water for per acre. If you see yellowing and rotting at the base, it may be foot rot \u2014 spray 1% Bordeaux mixture  (1 kg copper sulphate and 1 kg lime in 100 litres water per acre) before monsoon and repeat at 40-day interval around the collar region. also you can do cultural control such as mulching, proper drainage, and intercropping for extra income. Mulching with dry leaves and intercropping with crops like ginger or black pepper can give extra income. Arecanut starts yielding after 5 to 6 years and gives good production for 30 to 35 years. With proper care, farmers can get a steady income every year. Arecanut is a long-term crop, so take care in the early years \u2014 once it\u2019s established, it gives benefit for decades."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the sowing time of Brinjal and Bhindi (Okra)?","Final Answer":"Bhindi (Okra) and Brinjal (Eggplant) are not suitable for the rabi season (November to February) because both are warm-season crops, and the cooler climate slows germination, delays flowering, and increases the risk of frost damage and pest\/disease problems. The main sowing season of Brinjal is from July to August, and for a second crop, seeds are sown from March to April, and seedlings are transplanted after that. The ideal time to grow Bhindi (okra) is in spring (February to March) and kharif (June to July) because warm climates and monsoon rainfall support healthy growth, but waterlogging conditions during the rainy season must be avoided.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended cultivation practices for Betelvine?","Final Answer":"Betel vine cultivation requires careful attention to the region's unique hilly terrain and climatic conditions. Choose locations with a tropical humid climate with temperatures between 10\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, which are ideal for betel vine growth. Select sites with high relative humidity and partially shaded environments using live supports like arecanut or artificial pandals made from bamboo and shade netting. Planting is done during the optimal season of November-December or January-February in well-prepared raised beds, loamy or sandy loam soils rich in organic matter, with drainage trenches to avoid waterlogging. Well-drained upland areas with slight slopes are preferred over waterlogged lowlands. Prepare raised beds of 2 meters in width with drainage trenches (0.5m wide \u00d7 0.5m deep) between beds. Construct protective structures called \"Pan Boroj\" using bamboo poles and thatched roofing with paddy straw or dry grass for shade. Plant live supports like Agathi (Sesbania grandiflora) in rows to support vine climbing. Propagation should be done through healthy stem cuttings with 3-4 nodes, and 45 cm plant-to-plant spacing is maintained in two rows per bed. Weekly irrigation is essential, especially during dry spells, and mulching with banana leaves or local materials helps conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Vines should be tied every 15-20 days along supports using banana fiber or coir rope. Apply fertilizer based on soil test recommendation, a general guideline include: 60 kg nitrogen per acre (30 kg through neem cake and 30 kg through urea), 40 kg Phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085) through single superphosphate(SSP), and 12 kg Potassium(K\u2082O) through muriate of potash(MOP) in three split doses\u2014first at 15 days after lifting the vines and the second and third at 40\u201345 days intervals; also apply about 0.8 tonnes neem leaves or Calotropis leaves per acre in two split doses (0.4 tonnes each), covering them with mud on the beds. In the hilly terrain of Arunachal Pradesh, select naturally sheltered locations or create windbreaks to protect from strong mountain winds.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"For Finger millet, which method is better: dibbling or transplanting?","Final Answer":"Dibbling is better than transplanting for finger millet. Dibbling saves labor, needs less water, conserves moisture for a long time, is easier for hilly and rainfed areas, and is cost-effective. Growing plants by direct dibbling after the first good rain gives better crop stand and root development. Transplanting is more labor-intensive and needs a nursery, which is not practical for many farmers in the region. Use improved, region-tested varieties like VM 4 (VL Mandua 4) or Narendra Mandua 4, which are promoted by ICAR-RCNEH, Basar, and the Arunachal Pradesh Krishi Vigyan Kendras for local rainfed conditions. They are known for good yield potential and adaptability to the Northeast\u2019s climate. The recommended seed rate of 6-7 kg per acre and spacing of 25 \u00d7 10 cm are correct for this method. After sowing, to control weeds, apply Pendimethalin 30% EC at 1 liter per acre as pre-emergence within 3 days of sowing. Mix in 200-250 liters of water and spray evenly for full coverage. If a second flush of weeds appears, do a hand weeding at 20\u201325 days after sowing. Before sowing, apply 2 quintals of compost and 5 kg of Trichoderma per acre to improve soil health and manage soil-borne diseases. This is a highly recommended and sustainable approach. Keep the field clean for the first 40 days. This simple method gives strong root growth, better tillering, and good yield."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended cultural practices of Colocasia?","Final Answer":"Colocasia (taro\/arbi) is predominantly grown as a mixed crop in jhum (shifting cultivation) fields alongside paddy, maize, ginger, chilli, turmeric, cucurbits, or in homestead gardens. This traditional practice helps maintain soil fertility and supports diverse cropping systems. If you want to grow Colcasia, select well-drained loamy or sandy-loam soil with good organic matter. Prepare the land by ploughing and digging 2-3 times to achieve a fine tilth. Plant healthy corms or cormels at the onset of the rainy season (April\u2013May) with a spacing of 45 cm \u00d7 30 cm, using about 200\u2013250 kg of seed material per acre. Incorporate 5-6 tons of well-decomposed farmyard manure before planting to enrich the soil. Conduct 2-3 rounds of hand weeding to control weeds and perform light earthing-up when plants are 30\u201340 days old to cover and support developing corms. Since the crop prefers moist conditions but is sensitive to waterlogging, ensure proper drainage, especially in valley areas. On hill slopes, maintain adequate soil moisture using mulching with banana leaves or local organic materials to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Harvesting typically occurs  7\u20139 months after planting when the leaves begin to yellow and dry. Under good management, colocasia can yield approximately 60-80 quintals of corms per acre.  Leaves and petioles are also harvested periodically for use as vegetables or fodder. Additionally, avoid deep cultivation to prevent corm damage, and perform light hoeing and earthing-up twice (at 30\u201345 days and again at 60\u201375 days). The leafy parts may be smothered about one month before harvest to enhance corm development. Irrigate adequately, particularly during dry spells, using light and frequent watering; stop irrigation 3-4 weeks before harvest."}

Many farmers think crop insurance is the first step, but in reality, mushroom insurance is very rare here\u2014only a few districts in India have it, and most places in Arunachal don\u2019t. So, don\u2019t waste time searching for a policy that may not exist locally. Instead, the most important and reliable support for new mushroom growers is the government subsidy for building a mushroom shed. Under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM)\u2014active in Arunachal Pradesh\u2014you can get 40% (for general category farmers) to 50% subsidy (SC\/ST farmers) on the total cost of setting up a low-cost mushroom production unit. This includes racks, shelves, and other essential infrastructure.  To apply, go directly to your District Horticulture Officer (DHO) with your land\/lease papers, shed design or plan, and basic cost estimate. Once your unit is ready, you can check with the Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) or any local private insurers\u2014only if available in your district\u2014for special mushroom insurance that covers loss from diseases (like green mould, bacterial blotch), equipment failure (humidity\/temperature control), and natural calamities. If you do find it, Premium rates depend on your setup size, but generally small farmers pay around \u20b9300 to \u20b92,000 per crop cycle, and the rest is supported by the scheme or company plan. To apply, talk to your District Agriculture Office, KVK, or a lead bank like SBI or Arunachal Pradesh Rural Bank. Insure before spawning starts. If a disaster happens, you\u2019ll get compensation quickly\u2014so you can restart without a big loss. For keeping your mushroom rooms clean and disease-free, you have a couple of approved options. For a strong disinfection, use Formalin 37\u201340% at the correct dose of 2 litres per 100 litres of water. A safer and common alternative you can use is a 2\u20134% Bleaching Powder solution (that's 2\u20134 kg of powder in 100 litres of water). Both of these are approved for use. After disinfecting the room, it is absolutely essential to keep it sealed for 24-48 hours, and then ventilate it completely for several days (3 -5 days) before you introduce any mushroom spawn, to avoid health risks from formaldehyde fumes. Insurance plus clean production methods\u2014that\u2019s the safest way to keep your income stable, especially in a hill climate where one bad batch can wipe everything out."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the role of NABARD in giving loans for nursery and greenhouse cultivation?","Final Answer":"NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) supports farmers by facilitating easy and low-interest loans for setting up greenhouse and nursery farming. Farmers can get financial help for polyhouse structures, drip irrigation, shade nets, and other farm infrastructure through the Agri Infrastructure Fund (AIF). Under this, farmers get up to 85\u201390% of the project cost as a bank loan, and the government provides 3% interest subvention, which means farmers pay only 4% effective interest (if the base bank rate is 7%). This support is especially helpful for small, tribal, women, and hill-region farmers. On the other hand, MIDH (Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture) provides 40% subsidy for the general category and 50% or more for SC\/ST, women, and in the North-Eastern and hilly regions, farmers for nursery and horticulture development components. These two schemes work separately \u2013 AIF gives a loan with interest support, and MIDH gives a direct subsidy. To apply under AIF, farmers need land documents, a proper project report, and supplier quotations, and should visit their local bank or cooperative society for the latest procedure, as online application portals may change. Both individual farmers and FPOs\/SHGs are eligible to apply. For guidance, farmers can contact their nearest KVK, horticulture office, or lead bank branch. This financial help allows farmers in hilly regions to grow vegetables, flowers, and quality seedlings throughout the year with better income security."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Nematodes attack in Lime?","Final Answer":"Nematodes can damage lime roots, reduce nutrient and water uptake ability, and make the plant weak and less productive. The citrus nematode mainly attacks lime, and the root knot nematode can also cause damage in lime. To control nematodes in lime, an integrated, eco-friendly management approach is recommended. Use nematode-resistant rootstocks, such as Poncirus trifoliata and trifoliate orange, avoid planting lime in known nematode-infested soil, and ensure proper irrigation and drainage to maintain healthy root conditions. Before planting, cover moist nursery soil with transparent plastic sheets for 4-6 weeks during summer, apply neem cake at 1-2 kg per plant annually near the root zone, and apply Paecilomyces lilacinus or Pochonia chlamydosporia (nematophagous fungi) in soil near the root zone at 50-100 grams per plant mixed with compost. Apply Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 20 grams per tree at the early infestation stage. For severe cases, a soil drench with a specific nematicide like Fluopyram 34.48% SC @ 200-250 ml per acre can be used following all safety precautions and application guidelines. It is recommended not to harvest citrus until 28 days after the last application of Fluopyram to ensure residue levels are safe."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which kind of mushroom is suitable for cultivation during summer: paddy straw mushroom or oyster pleurotus spp. Mushroom?","Final Answer":"Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus spp.) grows well in cool, humid climates and is a good low-cost option for small farmers. Use popular and high-yielding varieties like Pleurotus florida, Pleurotus sajor-caju, and Pleurotus ostreatus, but for summer paddy straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea), it is more suited due to high temp tolerance, grows well in this region, and is easily available from KVKs, ICAR centers, or certified local spawn units. For 1 acre of mushroom shed, about 1,000\u20131,200 beds are needed using chopped, well-dried paddy straw or maize stalk as substrate. For disinfection, at first, soak the chopped straw in clean water for 6\u20138 hours, drain it well, and treat 35\u201340 kg dry straw by soaking it in hot water at a temperature of 60\u201365 \u00b0C for 4 hours, then repeatedly drain it well and cool before use. For chemical control, you can use Carbendazim 50% WP @ 20 g per 100 litres of water, soak the straw for 6 hours, then drain and cool before use. Both methods are effective, but hot water treatment is safer and leaves no chemical residue. While hot water treatment is preferred for its safety and Carbendazim 50% WP have some restriction as an alternative you can also used 1.75 grams of hydrated lime per liter of water to achieve a pH of 11-13 or soak the straw in this solution for 16-20 hours, then drain and cool or 1 liter of 3% hydrogen peroxide per gallon of water for soaking the straw. This method is effective, inexpensive, and leaves no harmful residues. Use a 3\u20135% spawn rate of the wet straw weight. After layering straw and spawn (3\u20135% spawn rate), tie the beds in polythene bags and keep in a dark, clean room at 25\u201328\u00b0C for 15\u201320 days for spawn running. After white mycelium fully covers the bed, shift to a room with light and 80\u201390% humidity. Mist with clean water twice daily and maintain airflow. Harvest starts within 20\u201325 days, and each bed gives 1\u20131.5 kg mushrooms over 3 flushes, so you can get yield per bed (3 to 4.5 kg per bed that means 1000 to 1200 per bed approx) that's means you can get around on an avg 5-6 ton per acre per year but it may touch up to 10 ton per acre under proper management practices, with a market rate of \u20b9100\u2013\u20b9150\/kg, offering good income for farmers. Avoid pesticides; instead, spray Neem oil @ 5 ml per liter of water around beds for fly or mite control. Remove infected beds if green mould appears, and keep rooms clean, well-ventilated, and hygienic. After 3\u20134 growing cycles, change the substrate and rest the room to avoid contamination."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Gandhi bug in Paddy (dhan)?","Final Answer":"The Rice Gandhi Bug is a major pest in paddy fields. It damages rice by sucking sap from developing grains, especially during the milky stage. This feeding causes the grains to become empty, shriveled, or discolored, reducing both yield and grain quality. To control rice gandhi bug, adopt an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods. Keep paddy fields and surrounding areas free of weeds and grasses, synchronize rice planting within the community so that all fields mature simultaneously, use dead fish or frogs fixed on bamboo sticks in paddy fields to attract gundhi bugs and control their population, use light traps or sweep nets, particularly in the evening when bugs are most active, encourage natural predators like spiders, coccinellid beetles, and parasitic wasps (Trichogramma spp.), and hang gunny bags soaked in cattle urine or cow dung at crop canopy height to attract and trap bugs. If infestation is severe (especially at the milking stage), then only spray insecticide such as Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 80-100 grams per acre mixed in 200 litres of water or Lambda-cyhalothrin 5 EC @ 100-120 ml per acre in 200 litres of water. Since the spray is applied at the grain-filling stage, Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) or waiting period after spraying is essential. The PHI for thiamethoxam on paddy is typically 14 days, and for Lambda-cyhalothrin is 21 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Rice Hispa in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Rice hispa-infected paddy shows white scratches and silvery growth in leaves, leading to poor growth and low grain formation. To control rice hispa, an integrated pest management approach (IPM) is recommended, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods. Plant early to avoid infestation, practice crop rotation with vegetables, maize, or pulses, maintain proper plant spacing, remove and destroy crop residues and infested plants, and avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Handpick and destroy the adult beetles, encourage or introduce spiders, damsel flies, and ladybird beetles, regularly collect and destroy adult beetles by using a sweep net, clip and destroy the top fourth of the leaves from heavily infested plants,  and use neem oil @ 5 ml per litre of water. If the pest population exceeds the economic threshold level (about 5-10 adults or larvae per hill), rotate insecticide spray of Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 60 ml per acre mixed in 200 litres of water or Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 80-100 grams per acre in 200 litres of water and spray in the early morning or late afternoon. The typical PHI(Pre-Harvest Interval) of rice for emamectin benzoate 5 SG is 14-21 days, and for Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC is 14 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the dose of Rogor in plants?","Final Answer":"Rogor (Dimethoate 30% EC) is a popular insecticide among farmers to control sucking pests like aphids, jassids, whiteflies, and thrips in crops like vegetables, pulses, and oilseeds. These pests suck plant juice and weaken the crop, leading to low yield. But farmers should know that dimethoate is banned for use on fruits and vegetables consumed raw in India because of food safety concerns. it is still allowed on non-food crops or crops not eaten raw, but always follow label instructions. You can spray it at 80-100 ml per acre mixed in 200 liters of water. But, As a safer and longer-lasting option, as an alternative, you can use Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40 grams per acre in 150\u2013200 liters of water. It gives good control of the same pests and is safe for crops and helpful insects. If using dimethoate on approved crops like pulses or oilseeds, always follow the pre-harvest interval (PHI) of at least 10 days before harvest. Spray in the early morning or late afternoon when sun heat is low for the best effect. Use a flat-fan nozzle for proper leaf coverage. Always wear gloves and a face cover while spraying. Avoid spraying during flowering to protect honeybees. To stop chemical resistance, do not use the same spray again and again. Rotate between Dimethoate 30% EC and Thiamethoxam 25% WG in different crop seasons. Spray only when pest numbers are high. No need to spray without reason\u2014it saves cost and keeps crops healthy. This easy method helps farmers protect their crop and earn better yield without harming nature."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Rubber cultivation in Doimukh area and sources for procuring seedlings?","Final Answer":"Rubber cultivation is possible in the Doimukh area due to suitable rainfall and climate. Farmers should first select high-yielding varieties like RRII 105, RRII 430, RRIM 600, or PB 260, which are in good demand and suitable for hilly Northeast regions and are recommended by the Rubber Board. These varieties give good latex yield and are disease-tolerant. To get healthy and certified planting material, farmers can contact the Rubber Board Field Office at Naharlagun and approach registered nurseries under the Rubber Board or ICAR centers that supply certified planting materials. It is always better to use budded stumps or polybag plants of 6\u20138 months age for good survival and growth. Before planting, clear the land, do proper pit digging (60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm), and apply 5 kg of compost and 50 grams of single super phosphate (SSP) per pit. Maintain spacing of 3m x 7m, which allows about 220 trees per acre for better growth and tapping access. After planting, mulch the base to retain moisture and control weeds. For weed control, apply pendimethalin 30% EC @ 1 litre per acre in 200\u2013240 litres of water as a pre-emergence spray immediately after planting, which is safer and suitable for upland plantations. Use a flat fan nozzle for uniform spray. Rubber trees require 6\u20137 years of growth before they are ready for tapping. Tapping begins when the tree reaches a girth of 50 cm at a height of 120 cm. Tapping should be done by using a sharp tapping knife to make a thin, half-spiral cut on the bark early in the morning. This technique allows latex to flow without harming the tree. Tapping should be done on alternate days or following a proper schedule, which helps in getting better and longer-lasting yields. Ethrel (ethephon) should only be used at 1.5% concentration after the third tapping season, once every 30\u201345 days, to avoid bark damage\u2014do not overuse. To earn a good price, farmers should collect latex in clean cups, use formic acid (150 ml per 10 litres of latex) for coagulation, and avoid adding water or impurities. The rubber sheets must be well-washed, smoked, and dried properly. Selling through registered cooperatives or Rubber Producers\u2019 Societies (RPS) ensures better market access and fair prices. Apply NPK 12:6:6 @ 12 kg per tree per year in 2\u20133 splits. Use Trichoderma during the monsoon to protect roots. You can also grow pineapple or ginger between rows in early years for extra income. Register your plantation with the Rubber Board to get subsidy, training, and support. With proper care, one acre can yield 300\u2013500 kg of dry rubber annually from the 8th year onwards. Farmers are advised to start small, take expert guidance, and maintain the plantation properly. Rubber offers long-term income and growing market demand, making it a promising option for farmers in this region."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the Soil Health Card?","Final Answer":"Soil Health Card is a government service that gives farmers a clear report about their soil\u2019s nutrient status. It shows the level of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, organic carbon, and micronutrients like zinc and sulphur. you can get this card free of cost from your nearby Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or Agriculture Office, State Agriculture Department, ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region, Arunachal Pradesh Centre, Basar after giving a small soil sample. By this card farmers can understand what their soil needs. Based on the report, they can apply the right type and right amount of fertilizer, which saves cost and increases yield. For example, if the card shows low nitrogen, the farmer can apply Urea at 80 - 100 kg per acre or use DAP 18:46:0 atapproximately 60 kg per acre  as basal dose. If zinc is low, for foliar spray Zinc sulphate (ZnSO\u2084 21%) at 0.5-1.0 kg mixed in 200 litres of water per acre to avoid phytotoxicity (leaf burn). Farmers should test soil once every 2\u20133 years before sowing season. This helps in planning better and avoids overuse of chemical inputs. Using the Soil Health Card, farmers can grow healthy crops, reduce wastage, and improve long-term soil fertility. It is a smart step for better income and better soil."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to grow Paddy in terrace in hilly areas?","Final Answer":"Due to the cold winter temperatures in the hilly areas, paddy is not grown as a Rabi crop, and it is grown mainly as a kharif crop(June-July). Terrace cultivation of paddy is a traditional and significant agricultural practice in the hilly areas. If farmers want to grow paddy in hilly areas in terraces, first cut the slopes into flat step-like terraces along the slopes to stop soil erosion and hold water, and build strong earthen bunds around each terrace. Before planting, plough and cross-till the soil using traditional tools to create a fine seedbed. Apply well-decomposed organic manure or farmyard compost to maintain soil fertility, and the recommended varieties are Apo, Bali, Vivek Dhan 65, IR-64 Sub1, and RC Maniphou. Prepare small raised nurseries in June to raise seedlings. Seedlings should be transplanted after 25 to 30 days into the terraced fields in July. After transplanting, maintain a 3-5 cm water level but follow intermittent irrigation to conserve water and avoid nutrient leaching. Use bamboo pipes or small earthen canals to provide irrigation from nearby streams to the fields. Remove weeds by hand, and control pests naturally or with traditional methods. In some places, farmers also raise fish in the paddy fields, which helps to control pests and gives extra income. Raising fish in the paddy fields can help control pests and provide additional income. Depending on the variety, the paddy takes three to six months to mature and should be harvested by hand with sickles. The grains are separated from the harvested stalks by threshing them against wooden surfaces. They are then sun-dried and kept in wooden or traditional bamboo granaries that keep out moisture and pests."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How many days soil sample can be stored for testing without experiencing any change?","Final Answer":"The time a soil sample can be stored before testing without significant changes depends on which type of analysis is being performed and the storage method used. A soil sample should ideally be tested as soon as possible after collection, but its storage life depends on the conditions. At room temperature in open air, it can be stored for only about one day before moisture loss, microbial activity, and nutrient changes occur, while if you keep it in a cool, dry place inside an airtight bag, it can be preserved for up to a week without major alteration; refrigeration at around 4\u00b0C can extend stability to two to four weeks for most nutrient analyses, and freezing at about \u221220\u00b0C can maintain its chemical and biological properties for several months, especially useful when testing for organic matter or microbial activity, though highly sensitive parameters such as nitrate and ammonium should be tested on the same day or stored under refrigeration to avoid rapid transformation."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Helicoverpa in chilli?","Final Answer":"To control Helicoverpa in chillies, also known as the cotton bollworm or gram pod borer, can cause significant damage to chilli crops by boring into fruits. Young larvae initially feed on flowers, flower buds, and young leaves. They feed on the seeds within the fruits, often hollowing them out and filling them with excrement. Damaged fruits are of poor quality, often rotting and becoming unfit for consumption or marketing. To control cultural practices like crop rotation, weed management, and intercropping. Mechanical control, like using pheromone traps and light traps. Biological control encourages natural enemies like ladybugs, lacewings, spiders, and parasitic wasps. Chemical control like spraying Emamectin benzoate 5% SG-80-100 gm\/acre in 200 L of water, and Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC-60 ml\/acre in 200 L of water."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the cultural practices of Rubber?","Final Answer":"To grow rubber in hilly areas, select gentle slopes or foothills with deep, well-drained, fertile soil rich in good organic content (pH 4.5-6.5). Avoid waterlogged and very steep slopes. Use healthy grafted recommended high-yielding clones such as RRII 105, RRII 430, RRII 414, RRII 429, RRIM 600, and GT1. Planting is best done before or during the onset of monsoon (June-July) to ensure good establishment. The pit is essential to provide favourable conditions for the early establishment and growth of young rubber plants. The recommended pit size is 90 \u00d7 90 \u00d7 90 cm or 75 \u00d7 75 \u00d7 75 cm. After digging, the pits should be refilled with topsoil mixed with organic manure and phosphatic fertilizer to ensure healthy growth. Planting material included budded stumps raised in polybags until ready for planting. Bud-grafted stumps can be planted directly in the field. When using polybag plants, a hole of the same size as the polybag should be dug in the center of the refilled pit. The plant is then placed in the hole after cutting the bottom of the polybag. A vertical cut should be made in the lower half of the polybag, the blank space filled with soil, and the polybag carefully removed to avoid disturbing the soil around the roots. Usually, about 180\u2013200 plants can be accommodated per acre. The recommended planting distance for flat and slightly undulated areas is 15 X 15 ft or 16 X 16 ft. In undulating and hilly lands, the spacing should be 20 X 10 ft or 22 X 11 ft. Fill pits with topsoil mixed with 2 kg of organic manure or farmyard manure during planting, or every 2-3 years, and apply a split application of 550 grams of urea, 315 grams of SSP, and 85 grams of MOP per tree annually. Provide shade and mulch to young rubber plants, give irrigation during dry spells, do regular weeding, and provide a fence to protect the plantation from animals. Regularly monitor for pests and diseases such as pink disease and root rot, and take proper control measures. Regularly prune and train young plants for optimal growth and good latex yield. Rubber tapping (latex extraction) starts once the rubber tree reaches the maturity stage, usually at 6-7 years."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to grow Walnut ?","Final Answer":"The state's cool, temperate climate provides a suitable environment for walnut cultivation. Walnuts require a significant number of chilling hours (1200-1500 hours below 7\u00b0C) during the winter for proper bud development and dormancy break. The ideal temperature for growth is between 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C. Prepare level beds or terraces on slopes with contour bunds to ensure proper drainage and prevent erosion, select deep silt loam soil that is rich in humus (pH 6.0 to 7.5), and remove plant debris and weeds during the land preparation process. Choose improved or locally adapted varieties, such as Wilson, Chandler, and Franquette; plant during the monsoon season (June\u2013July); dig 90 \u00d7 90 \u00d7 90 cm (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 ft) pits at least one month before planting and fill the bottom with topsoil mixed with 10\u201320 kg of well-rotted FYM and 200\u2013250 g of single super phosphate; and plant trees 8 X 10 meters apart in a square or rectangular shape. Young plants require regular irrigation, especially during dry periods. Mature trees are relatively drought-tolerant but benefit from supplemental watering during nut development (May-August). Install drip or sprinkler irrigation for a steady supply of moisture, and use mulch to retain soil moisture. Applying 750\u202fg urea, 1.5 kg SSP, and 750\u202fg MOP per tree per year, along with 50-100\u202fkg farmyard manure in December\u2013January, giving urea in split doses, and, for best results, following integrated nutrient management by applying 75% of the recommended NPK plus 68.75\u202fkg vermicompost per tree. During the dormant season, prune trees to remove diseased or weak branches, use sprays to control pests like walnut aphids and diseases like blight, and harvest nuts in the fall when husks split naturally. Remove side shoots during the early stage and prune lower branches when the tree reaches around 1 meter in height. Grafted trees begin bearing fruit in 3-5 years, with full commercial production expected in 8-10 years. In contrast, seedling trees take longer, with commercial production starting after 18-20 years."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control wild boars in Maize crop?","Final Answer":"Wild boars often destroy maize fields during the cob stage, mostly at night, by uprooting plants and eating the cobs, which causes heavy loss to farmers. To save the crop, farmers can follow an integrated wild boar management method by using a mix of simple farming practices, homemade tools, safe repellents, and natural ways. First, don\u2019t grow maize close to forest areas. Plant thorny bushes like agave or cactus on the field border to stop animals. Use early-growing maize varieties like Bio-9621 or HQPM-1 and harvest on time-don\u2019t wait after the cob gets dry. In the off-season, avoid growing maize again and again in the same land. Grow ginger or turmeric instead, which wild boars don\u2019t like. For protection at night, put solar lights or sound-making tins tied with a wire that make noise when animals enter.Also, hang cloth strips soaked in approved garlic-oil-based animal repellent (as per label dose) on ropes around the field. A strong smell helps keep wild boars away. Reapply every 7-10 days or after rainfall for better results. For chemical repellent, use a registered capsaicin-based repellent (1% EC) at 100-200 ml in 10 liters of water per 100 meters of field perimeter. You can buy it from a local agri-authorized shop or contact the local agriculture office. Spray or paint it on cloth strips, wooden sticks, or fence poles around entry points. Repeat every 10-12 days or after heavy rain for continued effect. Both are safe for animals and effective. You can also grow lemongrass or marigolds on bunds\u2014the strong smell helps drive away wild boars. Burning cow dung cakes mixed with neem leaves at night in the field corners also works. Lastly, if possible, all nearby farmers should work together by putting up fencing and keeping watch at night. This full method is farmer-friendly, safe, and works well to protect maize without harming wild animals."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowness in Tobacco leaves?","Final Answer":"Yellowing in tobacco leaves may be caused by nutrient deficiency (nitrogen, zinc), viral disease (Tobacco Mosaic Virus), or water stress. If older lower leaves become yellow and thin, it may be due to nitrogen deficiency; to correct this, apply balanced fertilizer with higher nitrogen content based on soil test results. If an irregular green mosaic pattern with a curled-like appearance is seen in leaves, it may be due to tobacco mosaic virus disease. To control this, uproot and destroy infected plants and avoid planting tobacco near chilli or tomato. If young leaves turn yellow between veins and veins remain green, it may be due to zinc deficiency. To correct this, apply 5-10 kg per acre of zinc sulfate in soil before sowing or spray 0.5% zinc sulfate (5 grams of zinc sulfate per liter of water). If young leaves become yellow and thin, it may be due to sulphur deficiency. To correct this, apply elemental sulfur or gypsum based on soil test recommendations and a foliar spray of 0.5% ammonium sulfate solution (5 grams per liter of water). Provide consistent water to ensure plants receive enough moisture and avoid waterlogging conditions; also, avoid using weed killers near the tobacco crops. It is recommended to spray during early morning or late afternoon and avoid during midday heat."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which type of vegetables are preferred to be cultivated during this time in Bomdila?","Final Answer":"Bomdila, located in the hilly region of Arunachal Pradesh, has a cool and pleasant climate that is very suitable for growing vegetables almost throughout the year. Farmers here generally practice off-season vegetable cultivation, which means they can grow certain crops earlier or later than the plains, fetching them better market prices. In the summer months (March to June), vegetables like peas, Indian beans, winged beans, carrots, radishes, cucumbers, and pumpkins do very well due to the cool temperature. During the monsoon season (July to September), crops like tomato, chilli, brinjal, leafy greens, and pumpkin are commonly grown. In the winter months (October to February), when the climate is quite cold, farmers mainly grow cole crops such as cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli, along with carrots, beetroot, potatoes, turnips, onions, garlic, and leafy spinach. This year-round cultivation helps farmers of Bomdila earn a steady income, and the advantage of the cool climate allows them to supply fresh vegetables to nearby markets when they are less available from the plains."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I  control foot and mouth disease?","Final Answer":"The appearance of wounds with a foamy discharge on the gums and feet of Mithun is a very serious and specific sign. This clinical presentation is highly characteristic of foot-and-mouth disease, a severe viral infection. Foot and mouth disease is extremely contagious and affects cloven-hoofed animals like mithun. The foam is created from excessive salivation due to painful mouth blisters, mixing with air. The virus also causes blisters on the feet, which lead to severe lameness and discomfort. The first and most critical step is to immediately isolate the affected animal from the rest of the herd. This isolation is vital to prevent the virus from spreading through direct contact or the air. You must contact your local government veterinarian or animal health authorities without any delay. In India, reporting FMD is mandatory under NADCP (National Animal Disease Control Programme). Farmers must immediately inform the local veterinary officer. Movement of all animals, people, and vehicles on and off the farm should be completely restricted. Implement strict biosecurity measures, such as disinfecting boots, equipment, and clothing. Always care for the healthy animals first before tending to the sick group to avoid carrying the virus. While awaiting veterinary guidance, provide supportive care to the sick animal to ease its suffering. Offer soft feed like green grass or soaked concentrates because chewing is very painful. Ensure the animal has continuous access to clean and fresh water to prevent dehydration. Provide a soft, dry bedding area to help protect the painful feet from further irritation. Gently clean the mouth and foot wounds with a mild antiseptic solution to prevent secondary infections. It is important to understand what actions to avoid in this situation. Do not wait to see if other animals become infected; assume the disease is spreading. Do not attempt to treat this with only antibiotics, as they have no effect on the viral infection. A severe bacterial infection might cause a discharge, but it would be pus-like instead of clear and foamy. Only a veterinarian can provide a correct diagnosis and an appropriate management plan for the outbreak."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to treat swelling in scrotal region of piglets?","Final Answer":"A swelling in the scrotal region of a piglet can have several possible causes. The most common reason for this type of swelling is a scrotal or inguinal hernia. This is a genetic condition where the intestinal canal slips into the scrotal sac. The swelling is usually soft, not painful, and might be pushed back gently into the abdomen. If the piglet is otherwise healthy, it can be monitored until weaning. However, surgical correction by a veterinarian is the recommended long-term treatment. Leaving a hernia untreated risks a life-threatening emergency called strangulation. Another cause can be an infection after castration, known as scirrhous cord. This leads to a hard, hot, and painful swelling that may contain pus. This condition requires immediate veterinary care, including draining and antibiotics. Proper hygiene during castration is the best way to prevent this infection; disinfection of instruments and using iodine tincture on the wound are essential for prevention. Sometimes, the swelling is simply bruising or a hematoma from an injury. This may appear as a discoloured, soft, and painful lump after trauma. These injuries often heal on their own if the piglet is kept in a safe pen. In other cases, the swelling could be a bacterial abscess. An abscess is a firm pocket of pus that feels soft in the center when mature. A veterinarian should lance, drain, and disinfect an abscess properly. It is very important to observe the piglet's overall behaviour. If the piglet is nursing, active, and not in pain, monitoring may be suitable. Any sign of pain, strangulation, or infection means a vet must be contacted. Always ensure proper cleanliness and safe housing to avoid many of these issues. Consulting a veterinarian is the best way to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What to do when Mithun is having a wound in his mouth with falling of saliva and wound in the hoof?","Final Answer":"It is suspected of being FMD (foot and mouth disease) until officially confirmed. This is a severe viral illness that spreads very quickly among livestock. The wounds are actually painful blisters that burst, causing the animal to drool excessively and become lame. Your first and most important step is to immediately isolate the sick Mithun. Move it away from all other healthy animals into a separate pen or area. This is the single most effective way to slow down the spread of the virus. You must contact your local veterinarian or government animal health department right away. Inform them of the symptoms you have observed. This disease is so serious that by law, it must be reported to the authorities. They will come to confirm the diagnosis and guide you on the official steps to take. It is crucial that you do not move any animals, people, or vehicles in or out of your farm. The virus can be carried on boots, clothes, tyres, and equipment. This quarantine helps protect your neighbour's livestock and your own healthy animals. While you wait for the veterinarian, you can provide supportive care to make the animal more comfortable. Offer soft and easy-to-eat feed like soft green grass or soaked concentrate feed. Chewing hard food will be very painful for the animal. Ensure it has constant access to clean water to prevent dehydration from the drooling. Provide a deep, soft, and dry bedding area for the animal to lie down. This will help prevent dirt from getting into the foot wound and making it worse. You can very gently clean the mouth and foot wounds with a mild saltwater solution. This can help keep the areas clean and prevent secondary bacterial infections. There are several things you must absolutely avoid doing. Do not wait to see if other animals get sick before taking action. Do not try to treat this disease yourself with only antibiotics, as they have no effect on the virus. Do not sell or give away any animals from your herd during this time. Always disinfect the equipment and footwear, and ensure that all healthy animals are vaccinated under NADCP. While Foot and Mouth Disease is the most probable cause, a veterinarian is the only one who can make a final diagnosis."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the vaccines available for dogs?","Final Answer":"Vaccines for dogs are divided into two main categories: core vaccines and non-core vaccines. Core vaccines are considered essential for all dogs regardless of their lifestyle or location. These vaccines protect against widespread, serious, and potentially fatal diseases. The core vaccines also include the vaccine for canine adenovirus, specifically the type that causes infectious hepatitis. This virus targets the liver, kidneys, and blood vessels and can be fatal. Another core vaccine protects against canine parvovirus. Parvovirus is a highly contagious and resilient virus causing severe vomiting and bloody diarrhoea, especially dangerous for puppies. The final core vaccine is for the rabies virus. Rabies is a fatal neurological disease that can be transmitted to humans and other mammals. Vaccination against rabies is required by law in most regions due to its public health significance. Non-core vaccines are administered based on a dog's individual risk factors. These factors include geographic location, local environment, and lifestyle. Another non-core vaccine protects against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. This vaccine is often recommended for dogs in areas where ticks that carry the bacteria are prevalent. The leptospirosis vaccine is also considered non-core but is becoming more routinely recommended. Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can cause liver and kidney failure and is transmissible to humans. The vaccine for canine influenza, or dog flu, is another lifestyle-based non-core vaccine. It may be advised for dogs that are frequently in contact with other dogs in social settings."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the best time to castrate piglets?","Final Answer":"The best time for castrating a piglet is a balance between animal welfare, practicality, and health. The most widely recommended and practiced time is when piglets are between 3 and 7 days old. This timing is considered optimal for several important reasons. At this young age, the procedure is physically easier and less stressful for the piglet. The piglet is small and easy to handle and restrain safely. The testicles are still small, and the scrotal incision is minor, leading to less pain and bleeding. The piglet is still receiving vital antibodies from the sow's milk, which helps prevent infection. It also allows the piglet to recover fully before the stress of weaning occurs later. Performing the procedure early minimizes the risk of complications, such as herniation or severe bleeding. It is crucial that the piglet is healthy and active and has fully consumed colostrum before being castrated. The procedure must never be performed on sick or weak piglets. Another common window is to perform castration at weaning, around 3 to 4 weeks of age, though this is less ideal. The piglet is larger, making restraint more difficult, and the procedure can be more painful. The absolute latest recommended time is before the piglet is 8 weeks old. After 8 weeks, the risk of complications increases significantly, and the surgery becomes a major stressor. The use of a sharp, disinfected instrument is non-negotiable for the health of the animal."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage maggot-infested wounds in Mithun (Gayal)?","Final Answer":"First, it is crucial to handle the Mithun (Gayal) calmly and gently. Maggot wounds are painful, so a stressed animal might injure itself or you. You'll need to clean the wound thoroughly. Start by gently removing the maggots. You can use a stick or forceps to pick them out, or pour a ready-made commercial veterinary fly repellent into the wound, which will make the maggots come out. After removing the maggots, clean the area with an antiseptic solution like a diluted Dettol or Savlon solution, or even just clean, warm water. Be sure to remove all dirt, dead tissue, and any remaining maggots. Next, you need to apply a good-quality wound dressing. Look for a veterinary ointment or spray that is specifically designed to kill maggots and repel flies. Products containing compounds like ivermectin or permethrin are very effective. You can also use a natural remedy by mixing neem oil with turmeric powder and applying it to the wound. Neem is a natural fly repellent and antiseptic, and turmeric helps in healing. Apply this mixture or the commercial product generously to the wound. Finally, you must dress the wound properly to prevent re-infestation. You can use a clean cloth or bandage to cover the wound. Check the wound daily and repeat the cleaning and dressing process until it starts to heal. If the wound is large and deep, or if the Mithun is showing signs of distress like fever or loss of appetite, it is essential to contact the nearest veterinary doctor or animal husbandry officer immediately. They can provide antibiotics and other necessary medicines to ensure a full recovery. Early action is the key to preventing a small wound from becoming a big problem."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to treat Foot and Mouth disease?","Final Answer":"The primary goal of treating foot-and-mouth disease lesions is supportive care, as there is no specific antiviral treatment for the disease itself. The first and most crucial step is to immediately isolate the affected animal to prevent the virus from spreading to the entire herd. You must contact your local veterinarian or government animal health authorities to report the disease, as it is often legally mandatory. While waiting for professional guidance, provide a soft, deep, and dry bedding area for the animal to lie down. This clean bedding is essential to keep dirt and manure away from the painful foot lesions and prevent severe bacterial infections. Offer the animal soft and highly palatable feed, such as fresh green grass, soft hay, or soaked concentrates. Chewing hard feed is extremely painful due to the mouth blisters, and the animal may refuse to eat. Ensure continuous access to clean, fresh water to prevent dehydration caused by excessive drooling and reluctance to drink. To manage mouth lesions, gently rinse the animal's mouth with a mild and soothing antiseptic solution. A common and effective rinse can be made with a weak saltwater solution. This helps keep the ruptured blisters clean and promotes healing. For foot lesions, carefully clean the affected hoof and foot with the same mild antiseptic solution. After cleaning, applying a topical antiseptic ointment or powder can help prevent bacteria from infecting the open wounds. In severe cases, where foot rot is a major risk, a protective bandage may be applied to the hoof. Pain management is a critical aspect of treatment for animal welfare. A veterinarian can administer anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. Antibiotic therapy may be prescribed by a veterinarian to combat or prevent secondary bacterial infections in the lesions. It is vital to remember that antibiotics have no effect on the FMD virus; they only treat bacterial complications. Extreme cleanliness must be practiced by the handler to avoid spreading the virus. Disinfect boots, clothing, and all equipment after contact with the sick animal. Always tend to be healthy animals first and isolated, sick animals last. The animal's recovery depends heavily on diligent nursing care and preventing complications. Most animals will recover from the virus within a few weeks if secondary infections are prevented. However, the economic impact and the high contagion level make this a very serious disease. All treatment should be carried out under the direct advice and supervision of a professional veterinarian."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Whether fingerlings from the nursery pond can be transferred to the main rearing pond?","Final Answer":"The transfer of fingerlings from a nursery pond to a main rearing pond is a critical step in fish farming that requires careful planning and depends on the fish's size. For Indian major carps, this typically occurs in July or August, once fingerlings reach the target size of 25-40 mm. This process, often called stocking, must be done correctly to ensure high survival rates and healthy growth. The success of the entire production cycle can depend on how well this transition is managed. The most important factor to consider is the size and health of the fingerlings. Fingerlings should be a uniform and appropriate size before being moved to avoid predation by larger fish in the main pond. They must be strong, active, and free from any signs of disease or physical damage. The timing of the transfer is also a key consideration for success. The main rearing pond must be fully prepared and ready to receive the new stock. A significant difference in temperature can cause thermal shock, leading to massive mortality. The process of acclimatizing the fingerlings to the new water conditions is absolutely essential. Add common salt (1-2%) to the transport water to reduce stress. After mixing water, float the sealed bag\/container in the main pond for 10-15 minutes to fully equalize the temperature before releasing the fish. After that, mix the water from the main pond with the water in the fingerlings' transport container. This slow mixing should be done over a period of 15 to 30 minutes. It allows the fish to slowly adjust to any differences in temperature, pH, and other chemical properties. After acclimatization, the fingerlings can be gently released into the main pond. Careful planning and gentle handling will ensure the fingerlings adapt quickly to their new environment and continue to grow well."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to treat ticks and lice in Pigs?","Final Answer":"The first and most important step is to isolate the infested pig from the rest of your herd immediately. This is crucial to prevent the parasites from spreading to your other animals. Ticks and lice can easily transfer through direct contact or via a contaminated environment. You must thoroughly clean and disinfect the pig's original living area after moving it. Next, you should consult a veterinarian for a precise diagnosis and treatment plan. A veterinarian can confirm the type of parasites and prescribe the most effective and safe treatment product. They can also rule out any secondary health issues caused by the infestation, such as anaemia or skin infections. Treatment typically involves the application of a parasiticide, which is a medication that kills parasites. These medicines come in several forms, including pour-on solutions, injectables, and sprays. It is absolutely vital that you use a product specifically labelled for use in pigs. The dosage must be calculated based on the pig's body weight to be both effective and safe. You must carefully read and follow all the instructions on the product label. Pay close attention to the withdrawal period, which is the required time between treatment and when the pig can be slaughtered for meat. Treat all pigs that have been in contact with the infested animal, even if they show no signs yet. This ensures you eliminate the entire population of parasites and prevent immediate re-infestation. Alongside treating the pig, you must also treat its environment. Ticks can hide in cracks, woodpiles, and bedding, while lice eggs can be attached to pen walls and feeders. Remove all old bedding and dispose of it properly. Thoroughly scrub and spray the pen, walls, and equipment with a recommended insecticide. Repeat the environmental cleaning as advised on the insecticide label to kill any newly hatched parasites. Provide supportive care to the infested pig to help it recover. Ensure it has a clean, dry, and comfortable place to rest. Offer a highly nutritious diet with adequate iron and protein to help it recover from any blood loss. Preventing future infestations is just as important as treating the current one. Conduct regular health checks on your pigs, looking closely through their hair for signs of parasites. Maintain clean, dry, and uncrowded living conditions for your animals. Consider using approved preventive parasite control measures as part of your routine herd management. A veterinarian is your best resource for creating an effective long-term parasite management strategy for your farm."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the Foot and Mouth disease in Livestock?","Final Answer":"The single most important action is the immediate and total isolation of any suspected animal. This means separating the sick animal from all healthy livestock in a secure enclosure. A strict quarantine must be imposed on the entire farm or premises. This involves prohibiting the movement of all animals, people, and vehicles onto or off the property. The immediate notification of the local government veterinarian is a legal requirement in most regions. This official reporting triggers a rapid response from animal health authorities. Trained officials will visit to confirm the diagnosis through clinical examination and laboratory testing. Once confirmed, a control zone is typically established around the infected farm. Movement restrictions are enforced within this zone to prevent any possible spread. A common control measure is the humane culling of infected animals and those that have been exposed. This stamping-out policy is used to eliminate the source of the virus and stop its transmission. The carcasses must be disposed of safely through burning, building, or rendering under veterinary supervision. Thorough cleaning and disinfection of all contaminated premises is absolutely essential. This includes buildings, vehicles, equipment, and any other exposed materials. Specific disinfectants proven to kill the FMD virus, like citric acid or commercial virucidal agents, must be used. Vaccination can be used as a control tool in certain situations, known as ring vaccination. This involves vaccinating all susceptible animals in a ring around the infected outbreak area. Vaccination does not cure sick animals but can protect healthy ones and slow the virus's spread. It is crucial to practice rigorous personal biosecurity. Anyone handling animals must disinfect their boots, clothing, and hands before and after contact. Equipment should not be shared between isolated infected animals and the healthy herd. A detailed record of all movements and actions taken must be maintained for tracing purposes. These control measures are disruptive but are necessary to contain the outbreak. The goal is to eradicate the virus, protect the national livestock industry, and resume trade. All actions should be carried out under the direct guidance and supervision of the veterinary authorities."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I castrate my 2 weeks old piglet?","Final Answer":"Castrating a piglet at two weeks of age is generally acceptable and falls within the commonly recommended timeframe. The standard recommended period for castration is between 3 and 14 days of age. Therefore, your two-week-old (14-day-old) piglet is at the very upper end of the ideal window. It is crucial to ensure the piglet is strong and healthy and has been nursing well before any procedure is considered. A piglet that is weak, small for its age, or shows any signs of illness should not be castrated. The procedure becomes more stressful and slightly more difficult as the piglet gets older and larger. At two weeks, the testicles are still relatively small, which can make the surgery technically straightforward. However, the piglet will be more mobile and may require more secure restraint than a younger piglet. Pain management is a critical factor for animal welfare at this age. The use of a local anaesthetic is highly recommended to numb the area and minimize pain during the procedure. Providing a long-acting pain relief medication after the surgery is also considered a best practice. The procedure must be performed with strict hygiene using sterilized instruments. A sharp, clean scalpel blade should be used to make precise incisions and minimize tissue damage. Aftercare is very important to prevent complications like infection or a serous cord. The piglet should be placed in a clean, dry, and comfortable pen to recover. Monitor it closely for signs of excessive bleeding, swelling, or infection in the following days. The ultimate decision should be made in consultation with a veterinarian if possible. A veterinarian can best assess the piglet's health and perform the procedure with the highest standard of care. If you are not experienced in piglet castration, seeking professional help is strongly advised to ensure the piglets' welfare."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Maggot infection in Goat?","Final Answer":"Maggot infestation, also known as myiasis or fly strike, is a serious, painful condition. The first step is to isolate the infected goat from the rest of the herd immediately. This allows you to treat the animal without stressing it further and prevents the spread of flies to others. You must carefully assess the extent of the infestation by examining the affected area, which is often the rear end, wounds, or soiled skin. The next crucial step is to carefully remove all the maggots from the goat's skin and tissue. This process requires great care to avoid causing more pain or damage. You will need to clip or shave the hair from around the infested area to see clearly and allow for proper cleaning. The maggots must be physically removed using tweezers or forceps. After physical removal, the area must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. A common and effective solution for flushing out deep maggots is hydrogen peroxide. It helps to kill remaining maggots and clean the wound through its bubbling action. After rinsing with peroxide, the wound should be cleaned again with a mild antiseptic solution like diluted betadine or chlorhexidine. It is absolutely essential to consult a veterinarian as soon as possible. A veterinarian can prescribe appropriate medications that are critical for recovery. They will likely prescribe a topical insecticide spray or ointment specifically designed to kill maggots. The veterinarian will also prescribe a course of antibiotics to combat the severe bacterial infection that always accompanies maggot wounds. Injectable pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication are also very important for the goat's welfare. The underlying cause of the infestation must be identified and addressed. Myiasis is often caused by soiling of the rear end from diarrhoea or by wounds from shearing, fighting, or other injuries. Preventing future infestations is just as important as treating the current one. Maintaining good hygiene in the goat's living quarters is the best prevention. This includes regularly cleaning pens and removing damp, soiled bedding. Implementing a regular worm control program is vital to prevent diarrhoea that soils the tail and rear legs. You should regularly check your goats, especially during warm weather, for any signs of wounds or soiling. Treating any wound immediately with an antiseptic spray can deter flies from laying eggs. Providing a clean, dry, and well-ventilated environment is the most effective long-term strategy for preventing fly strike."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What vaccination should be given to the Mithuns?","Final Answer":"Vaccination is a vital practice for protecting the health and productivity of Mithun. A core set of vaccines is considered essential for all animals due to common and dangerous diseases. The first and most crucial vaccine is for foot and mouth disease. This vaccine requires a first dose at three months of age. A booster dose is given four weeks after the initial vaccination. Because immunity is short-lived, revaccination must occur every six months for life. Another essential vaccine protects against hemorrhagic septicemia. This disease is often fatal, and outbreaks are common during monsoon seasons. The first dose of this vaccine is given at six months of age. An annual booster is required, ideally administered before the rainy season begins. Protection against Black Quarter, a fatal bacterial infection, is also a core requirement. This vaccine is first administered when the animal is six months old. An annual revaccination is necessary to maintain immunity. Optional vaccines are used based on the specific disease risks in a local area. In regions where anthrax is a known threat, an annual vaccination is recommended. For female calves, a one-time vaccination against brucellosis is available. This is given between four and eight months of age to prevent abortions. It is critical to only vaccinate animals that are healthy and not under stress. All vaccines must be sourced reliably and kept cold until the moment of use. Using sterile equipment and proper restraint ensures a safe procedure. Maintaining detailed records of each vaccination is essential for effective management. Consulting a local veterinarian is the best way to create a tailored health plan."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the vaccination schedule in Mithun?","Final Answer":"Vaccination is a fundamental part of preventive health care for Mithun to protect them from common and serious diseases. The vaccination schedule is designed to provide immunity at the most appropriate stages of the animal's life. The core vaccines for Mithun are for Foot and Mouth Disease, Hemorrhagic Septicemia, and Black Quarter. The vaccination for foot and mouth disease is critically important. The first dose of this vaccine is given when the calf is three months old. A booster dose is administered four weeks after the first dose. Because immunity from this vaccine is short-lived, revaccination is required every six months for the animal's entire life. The vaccination for hemorrhagic septicemia is also essential. The first dose is given when the calf is six months of age. An annual booster shot is required to maintain protection. This booster is ideally given just before the onset of the monsoon season when the risk of disease outbreak is highest. The vaccine for Black Quarter is another core component of the schedule. The first dose is administered at six months of age. An annual revaccination is necessary to ensure continued immunity against this fatal disease. Regarding where the vaccines are given, most vaccines are administered through an injection. The injection is typically given intramuscularly, which means into a large muscle mass. Common injection sites are the muscles of the neck or the hindquarters. This method ensures the vaccine is properly absorbed into the animal's system. It is crucial that all injections are given using sterile needles and proper technique to prevent infections. All vaccinations should be performed on healthy animals to ensure a proper immune response. It is highly recommended to consult with a local veterinarian."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the ticks and lice infection?","Final Answer":"The first step is to correctly identify the problem and understand that control is a two-part process: treating the animal and treating its environment. Ticks are larger, often visible attached to the skin, and can be felt as bumps when running your hand over the animal. Lice are smaller and harder to see; their presence is often indicated by intense itching, restlessness, and a rough, matted coat. The most important action is to isolate the severely infested animal from the rest of the herd to prevent the parasites from spreading. You must then choose an appropriate parasiticide, which is a chemical specifically designed to kill these parasites. These products come in several forms, including pour-on solutions, sprays, injectables, and dusting powders. It is absolutely vital that you use a product that is specifically labelled for the type of animal you are treating, such as cattle, goats, or pigs. The dosage must be carefully calculated based on the animal's body weight to ensure it is both effective and safe. You must read and follow all the instructions on the product label precisely. Pay close attention to the withdrawal period, which is the mandatory waiting time between treatment and when the animal's milk or meat can be consumed. Treat all animals that have been in contact with the infested one, even if they show no signs, to prevent immediate re-infestation. The animal's environment must be treated with equal importance, as this is where the parasites live and reproduce. Remove all old bedding, manure, and organic debris from pens, sheds, and shelters. Thoroughly spray the animal's living area with a recommended insecticide solution, focusing on cracks in walls, posts, and fences where parasites hide. Repeat this environmental treatment after two weeks to kill any new parasites that have hatched from eggs. For a severe infestation, a second treatment of the animal may be necessary after 2-3 weeks to break the life cycle of the parasites. Provide supportive care to heavily infested animals, as they are often anaemic and stressed. Ensure they have a highly nutritious diet with adequate minerals to help them recover from blood loss. Preventing future infestations is the ultimate goal of effective management. Conduct regular health checks on your herd by closely examining the skin, especially behind the ears, under the tail, and in the udder or scrotal area. Maintain clean, dry, and uncrowded living conditions to reduce stress and parasites."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the proper vaccination schedules of Mithun?","Final Answer":"The vaccination of Mithun (Bos frontalis) is carried out mainly under the supervision of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary and in collaboration with ICAR-National Research Centre on Mithun (ICAR-NRCM). Mithun are typically vaccinated twice a year during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, and vaccinations are mainly done to prevent diseases like Foot and Mouth (FMD), Hemorrhagic Septicemia (HS), and Black Quarter (BQ). These vaccination camps are organized through the government veterinary department; along with vaccination, Mithuns are often tagged and monitored for their overall health status. Besides the government veterinary department, ICAR-NRCM regularly conducted vaccination camps and an effective disease management program to reduce mortality rates, improve animal health, and support sustainable Mithun rearing. For detailed vaccine schedules, farmers and stakeholders are advised to consult their local veterinary offices or ICAR-NRCM authorities."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control ticks and lice infection in Yaks?","Final Answer":"Tick and lice infestations in yaks can cause severe irritation, blood loss, weight loss, and reduced productivity. Proper treatment and prevention are crucial for maintaining health and productivity. Veterinary-approved acaricides and insecticides, such as pour-on formulations containing permethrin, cypermethrin, or deltamethrin, can be applied directly to the animal\u2019s skin along the backline. The frequency of reapplication should strictly follow the product label, as modern formulations often provide protection for several weeks (commonly 4\u20138 weeks). Use the veterinarian's recommended dose of injectable or oral ivermectin preparations, which are effective against both tick and lice infestations in yaks. Since ivermectin has a prolonged duration of action, repeat treatments are generally given at longer intervals (commonly 28 days or more) to avoid overdose, toxicity, and rapid resistance development. Treatment alone is often not enough to control parasitic infestations; preventive measures are also essential. Maintain cleanliness in yaks' shelter, regularly remove bedding or dung, and rotate grazing areas. It is also recommended to always consult with a qualified veterinarian for selecting appropriate products and for guidance on dosage and safety to avoid chemical resistance or toxicity."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Will the milk of rabies-vaccinated cows be consumable by human beings?","Final Answer":"Milk from a rabies-vaccinated cow is safe for human consumption. There is no scientific evidence that the rabies virus can be transmitted through the milk of vaccinated or healthy animals. According to health authorities and research, the rabies virus is not found in milk or milk products, and human rabies cases from consuming milk have not been reported. However, it is safe to ensure milk is pasteurized or boiled before consumption to eliminate any possible risks. But if a cow is vaccinated after a suspected rabid bite, its milk should not be used and must be discarded during the full observation period, which may last for several months."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding the interest rate of an agri-term loan?","Final Answer":"Interest rates for agriculture term loans differ based on the bank, loan scheme, and amount. While it is true that you can get a loan from a bank with interest rates that vary, you must know about the special schemes that are specifically designed for farmers in your state. These schemes offer far better terms. The most important ones are the Atma Nirbhar Krishi Yojana (ANKY) for general agriculture and the Atma Nirbhar Bagwani Yojana (ANBY) for horticulture. These are \"credit-linked subsidy\" programs, meaning the government gives you a large subsidy directly tied to your bank loan. The funding pattern for these schemes is very favourable: the government provides a direct 45% subsidy, which you do not have to pay back. The bank provides a 45% loan, which you will need to repay. And your own contribution, or \"margin money,\" is only 10% of the total project cost. This means a massive 90% of your project is funded by the government and the bank, making it much easier for you to start or expand your business. For smaller, short-term expenses like crop loans or Kisan Credit Cards (KCC), the state government also offers the Chief Minister's Krishi Rinn Yojana (CMKRY). Under this scheme, if you take a loan up to \u20b93 lakh and repay it on time, the interest rate can be effectively zero percent due to an interest subvention from both the state and central governments. For more information, do contact your nearest bank branch."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended fish species and techniques for Fish farming?","Final Answer":"In your region, fish farming is completely carp-centric. In medium-altitude areas (up to 3500 ft), the popular and recommended fish culture is Indian major carp (catla, rohu, and mrigal) and exotic carp (silver carp, grass carp, and common carp). For higher altitude areas (more than 3500 ft), cold water species are recommended, such as grass carp, silver carp, trout, mahseer, snow trout, and common carp. Interested farmers can grow fish through the composite fish culture technique or integrated farming. In the composite fish culture technique, different compatible species with complementary feeding habits are developed together in a pond. Integrated farming, such as paddy cum fish farming (rearing fish in rice fields), duck cum fish farming, or pig cum fish farming (using livestock waste as natural fertilizer, no need to apply external fertilizer), is also popular. For successful composite carp culture, prepare ponds with 1.5 to 2.0 meters, provide an inlet and outlet for water management, clear weeds from the pond, and add lime and manure to maintain water quality and fertility. The recommended stocking density is 2400-4000  fingerlings\/acre with a species ratio of Catla 30%, Rohu 30%, Mrigal 20%, Grass carp 10%, Silver carp 5%, and Common carp 5%. Provide a supplementary feed mixture of mustard cake and rice bran daily to ensure the healthy growth of fish."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the causes of slow growth in Fish, and how can I correct it?","Final Answer":"Slow growth of fish is due to several reasons, such as poor water quality, nutritional deficiencies, overstocking of fish in a pond, inadequate feeding, poor-quality fingerlings, and cold water in hill conditions. To correct this, ensure adequate oxygen by using aerators or fountains, especially during early morning hours; regularly check the pH of pond water; if it is acidic, apply lime to the pond bottom during the off-season; provide nutritionally balanced feed with a protein level (25-35%) suitable for the fish species; maintain proper pond hygiene by removing organic matter; and control weed growth in the pond. Use fast-growing and locally adapted fish species or improved breeds such as Indian major carps (rohu, catla, and mrigal), avoid overstocking of fish, maintain 6000 to 8000 fingerlings per acre, and procure fingerlings from certified hatcheries. Regularly observe your fish for any signs of disease, such as sores, lesions, or abnormal behaviour, and use a salt bath according to the local fishery extension officer's recommendation to control external parasites. Apply a feed mixture of rice bran and mustard oil cake (1:1 ratio) at 2\u20133% of fish biomass\/day and consult with local fishery extension experts and KVKs."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to treat diarrhoea in Broiler farm?","Final Answer":"Diarrhea is a symptom, not a disease. Before you can treat diarrhea, it is important to identify the actual cause of it. Diarrhea in a broiler can be caused by various factors such as bacterial infections (E. coli, Salmonella, Clostridium), viral infections (rotavirus, reovirus), coccidiosis, improper feed or water quality, stress, or antibiotic misuse. If a high proportion of the flock is affected, or if the affected birds show other symptoms like lethargy, loss of appetite, or bloody droppings, it is crucial to consult a veterinarian immediately. To control or prevent this, separate sick birds to prevent spread, clean and disinfect the poultry house feeders and drinkers, ensure birds have a fresh, clean drinking water source, and supplement a mixture of common salt (1 g\/L) and sugar\/jaggery (10 g\/L) in clean drinking water to combat dehydration. If diarrhea is caused by bacteria (e.g., E. coli or Salmonella), a veterinarian may prescribe an antibiotic like Neomycin, Tylosin, Chlortetracycline, or Sulfadimidine (use veterinarian-recommended dose), and if the diarrhea is caused by coccidiosis, an anticoccidial medication such as amprolium or sulfa drugs may be necessary. Besides this, ensure good quality feed with probiotics or prebiotics and vaccinated broilers as per the vaccine schedule to prevent enteric diseases. Always consult a veterinarian before using any medication for correct diagnosis and specific treatment according to your farm, and also, overuse of antibiotics can lead to drug resistance, which is a major problem in poultry farming.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the causes of slow growth of Vanraja poultry birds and how can I correct it?","Final Answer":"Vanraja is a dual-purpose poultry breed known for its fast growth and good egg-laying capacity. Vanraja chicken may experience slow growth due to several reasons, such as poor nutrition, inadequate feed, poor feeding quality, inadequate water supply, poor management, and disease infection (Newcastle Disease, Coccidiosis, and Fowl Pox). For the first 6 to 8 weeks, provide complete balanced feeds that contain necessary protein, energy, and micronutrients; supplement 15% fresh azolla with locally available feed ingredients; supplement the birds' diet with grains like maize, bajra, or rice bran at 25-50 grams per bird per day; ensure continuous access to fresh water; and monitor growth weekly and adjust feeds accordingly. Maintain the correct brooder temperature (for day-old chicks, the ideal temperature will be around 32-33\u00b0C and gradually decrease by about 2\u00b0C each week until it is around 26\u00b0C), avoid overcrowding, maintain a proper vaccination schedule as recommended by a veterinarian to prevent Newcastle and fowl pox disease, and regularly deworm the birds, especially if they are in a free system. Always consult with a veterinarian for proper suggestions and guidance."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is Layer farming and how to do?","Final Answer":"Layer farming is the practice of raising hens for egg production and is a significant and growing sector in the poultry industry. Layer farming is a profitable venture, because of high demand for eggs, and the humid subtropical climate in the valleys and foothills is generally suitable for poultry farming. Choose a location with good drainage, a reliable water supply, and adequate space for poultry sheds, and maintain proper insulation and ventilation to protect from cold. If you want to start layer farming, set up a poultry farm; a small- to medium-sized farm is suitable for 500-2000 birds. Essential infrastructure like proper nesting boxes, feeders, and drinkers are required, and commercial breeds like Vanaraja, Rhode Island Red, BV-300 (white eggs), BV-380 (brown eggs), and White Leghorn are popular for egg production. Provide balanced feed formulated (16-18% protein and calcium) to meet the nutritional requirements of layers, maintain optimum temperature (18-24\u00b0C) and lighting schedule (16 hours of light per day) to stimulate egg laying, and maintain a proper vaccination schedule according to the veterinarian's recommendation to prevent Ranikhet (Newcastle disease) and infectious bursal disease (Gumboro). With proper management, layer farming (egg production) can provide a steady income. The Arunachal Pradesh government and NABARD provide subsidies for poultry farmers. Farmers interested in layer farming can contact the local animal husbandry office or KVK for training. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control diseases in Chilli?","Final Answer":"Chilli is an important cash crop, but farmers often face losses due to major diseases if timely protection measures are not taken. The three most serious diseases of chilli reported in the region are Anthracnose\/Fruit Rot (Colletotrichum capsici), Powdery Mildew (Leveillula taurica), and Leaf Curl Disease (caused by Chilli Leaf Curl Virus, transmitted by whitefly). For anthracnose, you should use disease-free seed and treat seeds with Thiram 75 WP at 2-3 g\/kg of seed before sowing. Field sanitation, crop rotation, and destruction of infected fruits are important. On disease appearance in standing crop, spray Mancozeb 75 WP at 600-800 g\/acre or Propiconazole 25 EC at 200 ml\/acre, repeated at 10-15 day intervals if needed. For powdery mildew, which spreads quickly in warm and humid weather, ensure proper plant spacing and avoid excess nitrogen. For symptoms in standing crops, spray Wettable Sulphur 80 WP at 1.25\u20131.3 kg\/acre or Hexaconazole 5 EC at 200 ml\/acre, repeated after 10\u201312 days if disease persists. For leaf curl virus, there is no direct chemical cure, so management focuses on controlling the vector whitefly. Use resistant varieties where available, remove and destroy infected plants early, and control whitefly by spraying Neem Oil 10,000 ppm (5 ml per liter of water or 1 liter\/acre) or chemical insecticides like Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 40 g\/acre or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 60-80 ml\/acre, ensuring thorough coverage of the underside of leaves. Install yellow sticky traps (6\u20138 per acre) and maintain field sanitation to further reduce the spread. In chilli cultivation, you must always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure the produce is safe for consumption and free from harmful residues. PHI of Mancozeb 75 WP requires at least 7 days before harvest, while Propiconazole 25 EC and Hexaconazole 5 EC need a longer interval of about 14 days. Wettable Sulphur 80 WP has a shorter waiting period of around 5 days, making it safer for use closer to harvest. Among insecticides, both Thiamethoxam 25 WG and Imidacloprid 17.8 SL should not be sprayed within 7 days of harvest."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to treat Poultry blindness?","Final Answer":"Blindness is a symptom, not a disease. The probable causes of blindness in poultry are nutritional deficiency (lack of vitamin A), external eye injuries from foreign bodies, or disease infection (such as infectious coryza, IBD disease, Marek disease, and fowl pox). If blindness is due to vitamin A deficiency, immediately supplement vitamin A through feed or water as prescribed by a veterinarian. Infectious diseases like infectious Marek disease and fowl pox can cause blindness in poultry; to prevent this, vaccination, according to veterinarians, is mandatory. Infectious coryza disease also causes blindness. To control this, isolate infected birds and use antibiotics as per the veterinarian's recommendation. If you notice any signs of blindness on your farm, immediately consult with a veterinarian because early diagnosis can prevent the spread and effectively manage the symptoms."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Fishery?","Final Answer":"Fish farming is a great way to earn a living due to our rich water resources. The most popular and suitable fish for farming in our state fall into two main categories based on our varied climate and altitude. In the lower and middle-altitude regions (below 1,000 meters), which have warmer temperatures, farmers commonly raise Indian Major Carps (IMCs) like Rohu, Catla, and Mrigal, as well as exotic carps like Common Carp, Grass Carp, and Silver Carp. These fish are fast-growing and are well-suited for traditional composite fish culture, where different species are raised together to utilize all layers of the pond. For the higher-altitude regions (above 1,200 meters), with their cold, fast-flowing streams and lakes, coldwater species are more suitable. The most popular fish in these areas are trout, especially rainbow trout and brown trout, and our indigenous golden mahseer.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to avoid oxygen depletion in Fishpond?","Final Answer":"Oxygen depletion in a fish pond occurs when the oxygen demands exceed the supply, leading to low dissolved oxygen levels that can stress and kill fish. The reason for oxygen depletion in the field may be due to high water temperature, over-fertilization, excessive organic matter in water, sudden death of a large number of algae, water stratification, and lack of water circulation. In oxygen-deprived ponds, fish stop eating and gulp for air at the water's surface near the pond's edge, with water colour changes from blue\/green to greyish, brown, or black. To correct oxygen depletion, immediately aerate the ponds using pumps, paddle wheels, or aerators, which help in circulating oxygen throughout the ponds; broadcast Potassium Permanganate (KMnO\u2084) at 2\u20135 kg\/acre to quickly increase dissolved oxygen levels; and stop feeding temporarily to reduce the oxygen demand on waste and uneaten food. To prevent this, control excessive algae and aquatic vegetation growth, remove organic debris, avoid overfeeding, stock algae-eating fish like grass carp, provide shade to reduce water temperature, and monitor dissolved oxygen levels in early mornings and hot weather to detect problems early."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the proper IBD vaccination schedule of Poultry?","Final Answer":"The infectious bursal disease (IBD), also known as Gumboro disease, is a highly contagious viral disease in commercial broiler and layer chickens. A proper vaccination schedule is essential to prevent the disease. The IBD (Infectious Bursal Disease) vaccination schedule for poultry is varies according to the type of birds being raised, with broiler chickens receiving their first IBD vaccination at 7-9 days of age via the intraocular route or drinking water, followed by a booster dose at 16-18 days through drinking water, or alternatively, first at 14 days via the intraocular or intranasal route and the second IBD booster at 28 days via drinking water. Layer birds follow a slightly different schedule, with the first IBD vaccination given at 14-16 days via the intraocular or drinking water route, and a booster dose given at 24-26 days through drinking water. Backyard poultry, including Vanraja and indigenous breeds, receive the Gumboro (IBD) vaccine as one drop via the eye route on the 7th day, followed by a booster dose as one drop orally on the 14th day. Always consult with a qualified poultry veterinarian from the state's Animal Husbandry department or a private practitioner; they can suggest a proper IBD vaccination schedule based on your specific farm's risk factors and the prevalence of IBD in your locality. Ensure the vaccines are stored and transported correctly at 2-8\u00b0C, vaccinate the birds at a time when they are not under stress from heat and cold, and for drinking water administration, ensure that water is free from chlorine and disinfectants."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which Fishery schemes are available?","Final Answer":"The government of India, along with the Department of Fisheries of the Arunachal Pradesh government, has launched several central and state-sponsored schemes on fisheries to boost the fisheries sector across the state.

There are 3 common species of bats. 1. Rain Quail (Coturnix coromandelica) 2. Manipur Bush Quail (Perdicula manipurensis) 3. Jungle Bush Quail (Perdicula asiatica). Quails are small, ground-dwelling birds. Quails are known for being very secretive and are more often heard than seen. They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of seeds, grains, leaves, and insects. In India, hunting most wild quails is illegal due to conservation concerns. They are often raised in captivity for food and eggs. These are considered a delicacy."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the lameness in poultry?","Final Answer":"Lameness in poultry refers to any condition that impairs the ability to walk or move normally. It is common in fast-growing broilers and chickens, as their skeletal system may struggle to keep up with rapid muscle and body weight development. It can happen due to genetic factors. Nutritional deficiencies, such as calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D, and various bacteria and viruses, can cause lameness, and environmental and poor management can also cause lameness, such as poor litter quality and overcrowding. Controlling lameness requires a comprehensive multi-approach, such as working with a breeder who focuses on balancing rapid growth with the development of strong, healthy skeletal structure. Ensure a proper balanced diet with adequate levels of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D. Supplement the feed with other essential nutrients like biotin and choline if necessary. Follow the proper vaccination schedule as recommended by a veterinarian to prevent viral diseases that cause lameness. Keep the litter dry, loose, and clean to prevent footpad issues, and ensure proper ventilation to remove moisture. Avoid overcrowding, and provide sufficient space for birds to move around comfortably without causing physical stress. Thoroughly clean and disinfect the sheds and all equipment between flocks."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Ginger cultivation?","Final Answer":"Ginger is one of the most important spice crops grown, and it is well-suited to the state\u2019s hilly climate and fertile soils. Ginger grows best in well-drained loamy soil rich in organic matter and under partial shade with good rainfall. Farmers usually plant ginger during April-May with the onset of pre-monsoon showers. Popular high-yielding varieties include Nadia, Suprabha, Suruchi, Suravi, Varada, IISR Mahima, and IISR Rejatha. These varieties are not only high-yielding but also have good rhizome quality and higher recovery of dry ginger and oil content. The average yield under good management practices is about 70-90 quintals per acre, while improved varieties like Varada and IISR Mahima can give up to 100-120 quintals per acre in the region. For sowing, use rhizome seed pieces weighing 20-25 g each, at a seed rate of about 5-6 quintals per acre. Use only healthy, disease-free rhizomes. Before planting, treat the rhizomes with Mancozeb at 3 g\/kg of rhizomes by dipping them for 30 minutes and drying them in the shade. Alternatively, you can use Trichoderma viride at 5-10 g\/kg as a biological seed treatment to prevent fungal diseases. Maintain adequate mulching for moisture conservation, and provide regular weeding and earthing-up."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control heat stress in poultry?","Final Answer":"Heat stress in poultry is a major challenge, especially in regions with hot climates. It occurs when a bird's body is unable to maintain a balance between the heat it produces and the heat it loses to the environment. Unlike mammals, chickens and other poultry do not have sweat glands, so they must rely on different mechanisms to cool themselves. A bird's body temperature is normally around 41-42\u00b0C (106-108\u00b0F). The \"thermoneutral zone,\" where they are most comfortable, is typically between 18 and 21\u00b0C. When the ambient temperature rises above this zone, the bird's thermoregulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. The primary factors contributing to heat stress are high ambient temperature and high humidity. Direct sunlight or heat from the surrounding environment (e.g., a hot roof or floor) also adds to the heat load. Fast-growing broiler chickens have a high metabolic rate, which generates a large amount of internal body heat. This makes them particularly susceptible to heat stress. Heat stress has a wide range of negative impacts on poultry, affecting their health, welfare, and productivity, including the most common sign. Birds open their mouths and breathe rapidly to lose heat through evaporation. This can lead to respiratory alkalosis (an imbalance in blood pH) due to excessive carbon dioxide loss. Birds hold their wings away from their bodies to increase surface area and allow for heat dissipation. They become lethargic and spend more time resting. Broilers may experience a significant drop in body weight gain due to reduced feed consumption. Heat stress can suppress the birds' immune system, making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Meat quality can be affected, leading to reduced water-holding capacity and changes in colour and texture. Managing heat stress requires a proactive approach that combines proper housing, feeding, and water management, such as ensuring excellent air circulation at the bird level to remove heat and humidity. This can be achieved with fans. Use evaporative cooling systems like foggers, misting systems, or cool pads to lower the ambient temperature, especially in the hottest hours. Insulate the roof and walls to prevent solar heat gain. Reduce the stocking density to give birds more room to move and dissipate heat. Ensure Ample, Cool Water: Provide easy access to a sufficient number of waterers. Regularly flush water lines to ensure the water is fresh and cool. Add electrolytes to the drinking water. This helps replenish minerals lost during panting and maintains the bird's hydration and acid-base balance. Feed birds during the cooler parts of the day (early morning and late evening\/night). This encourages them to eat when they are less stressed. Formulate a diet that is more nutrient-dense to compensate for reduced feed intake. Supplement the feed or water with vitamins (especially A, D, E, and C), minerals (like zinc and chromium), and other additives that can help reduce oxidative stress and support the immune system."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the treatment for white diarrhea in a broiler farm?","Final Answer":"White diarrhoea in poultry, particularly in young broiler chicks, is a common and serious symptom that can indicate several underlying diseases. The most notable cause is pullorum disease, a highly contagious bacterial infection. However, other conditions, such as coccidiosis and even simple chilling, can also cause white, watery droppings. Before you can treat the condition, it's crucial to identify the root cause. A veterinarian or a poultry health expert can perform a proper diagnosis through laboratory tests. Pullorum Disease (Bacillary White Diarrhoea): Caused by the bacterium Salmonella pullorum. This is a highly infectious disease that is transmitted from the hen to the chick through the egg. It can cause high mortality rates (80-100%) in chicks. Coccidiosis: Caused by a protozoan parasite, Eimeria. While coccidiosis often causes bloody or orange-colored diarrhoea, some forms can present with white, watery droppings. Chilling, poor feed quality, or other bacterial infections can also result in white diarrhoea. The treatment approach depends entirely on the cause. It is essential to consult with a veterinarian before administering any medication, as using the wrong drug can be ineffective and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Treatment for Pullorum Disease: While some antibiotics can reduce mortality, they are generally not recommended as a primary treatment. This is because the goal is not to \"cure\" the birds but to eradicate the disease from the flock. The standard and most effective method for controlling pullorum disease is to depopulate the infected flock. This is because birds that survive the infection will become \"carriers\" and continue to spread the bacteria to other birds, especially through their eggs, making the problem chronic. A strict biosecurity protocol is the most important measure to prevent pullorum. This includes sourcing chicks from hatcheries certified to be Pullorum-free, testing breeding flocks for the presence of the bacteria, strict hygiene, and disinfection of all equipment and houses. Treatment for Coccidiosis: If coccidiosis is the cause, specific anticoccidial drugs (like amprolium or sulfa drugs) are administered through drinking water. Provide electrolytes and multivitamins in the water to help the birds recover from dehydration and to support their immune systems. Coccidiosis is often a result of poor hygiene. Keeping the litter dry and clean is crucial for preventing and controlling outbreaks. Regardless of the specific cause, the following management practices are crucial for both treatment and prevention of white diarrhoea: As soon as you see a bird with white diarrhoea, isolate it from the rest of the flock to prevent the spread of the disease. Provide fresh, clean drinking water at all times. Maintain dry, clean litter. Wet litter is a breeding ground for bacteria and parasites. Ensure the birds are receiving a high-quality, balanced feed appropriate for their age. The most important step is to consult a qualified veterinarian. They can accurately diagnose the problem and recommend the correct course of action, which may include medication, supportive therapy, or culling."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Package of practice for Paddy?","Final Answer":"Paddy is the most important staple food crop, and because of the state\u2019s rainfall pattern and hilly climate, farmers cultivate different types of rice depending on the season. The three major types of rice grown are Ahu, Boro, and Sali rice. Ahu Rice (Pre-monsoon Rice) is the early rice grown during March to June in upland and midland areas, using pre-monsoon showers. It matures early and provides food before the main season crop. Popular varieties are RCPL 1-10, RCM 9, and Naveen, giving an average yield of 12-15 quintals\/acre. Boro Rice (Winter Rice) is grown from November to May in areas where irrigation is available, especially in valleys and low-lying fields. It is transplanted in December-January and harvested in April-May. Suitable varieties include Bahadur, Pooja, and CAU-R1, with yields of about 15-18 quintals\/acre. Sali Rice (Kharif\/Main Season Rice) is the major rice crop, grown during the monsoon season (June\u2013November) under rainfed lowland and irrigated conditions. It is transplanted in July-August and harvested in October\u2013November. High-yielding varieties recommended for the Sali season are RCM 10, RCM 11, RCM 13, Luit, and Rajalaxmi, which can yield 18-22 quintals\/acre. You should prepare your field thoroughly by ploughing and puddling it 3-4 times. This creates a soft mud that is ideal for transplanting seedlings and also helps to control weeds. For better growth, apply FYM\/compost at 4-5 tonnes per acre before puddling. For the cultivation of paddy in upland use 79 kg urea, 348 kg Single Superphosphate (SSP), and 49 kg Muriate of Potash (MOP) per acre.  For the cultivation of paddy in lowland and hilly regions, use 88 kg urea, 348 kg Single Superphosphate (SSP), and 49 kg Muriate of Potash (MOP) per acre. For nursery raising, about 20-25 kg of seed per acre is sufficient. Seeds should be treated with Mancozeb 75 WP at 2.5-3 g\/kg of seed before sowing to protect against seed-borne diseases. Seedlings of 20-25 days age are ideal for transplanting in puddled fields, keeping a spacing of 20 x 15 cm for better tillering and weed management."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I treat the cough problem in goat?","Final Answer":"Coughing in a goat is a symptom, not a disease itself. It's a sign that something is irritating the respiratory system. Therefore, effective treatment depends on accurately identifying the underlying cause. A veterinarian's diagnosis is crucial, as treating the wrong condition can be ineffective and harmful. Common Causes of Coughing in Goats:Dusty or moldy hay, ammonia buildup from poor ventilation and soiled bedding, dust in the air from dry conditions, or poor pen design. Goats can become infected with lungworms (e.g., Dictyocaulus filaria) by ingesting larvae from contaminated pastures. The larvae migrate to the lungs, causing irritation and a persistent cough. Bacterial Infections (Pneumonia). This is a serious cause of coughing, especially in young or stressed goats. Common bacteria include Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. Viruses like Parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) or the Caprine Arthritis and Encephalitis (CAE) virus can lead to a cough, which may also predispose the goat to secondary bacterial infections. Stress from transportation, overcrowding, or sudden weather changes can weaken a goat's immune system, making it more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. While less common, goats can have allergic reactions to certain feeds or environmental factors, leading to a cough. To treat the goats, identify and eliminate the irritant. If the cause is dusty hay, switch to a cleaner source. If it's ammonia, improve ventilation in the barn and change the bedding more frequently, and provide clean, fresh air. Ensure the goat's living space has good airflow without direct drafts. 2. Parasitic Infections (Lungworms): Deworming: This is the primary treatment. A veterinarian can conduct a fecal test to confirm the presence of lungworms and recommend an effective dewormer (anthelmintic). Common medications include ivermectin or other broad-spectrum dewormers. Pasture Management:To prevent reinfection, rotate pastures to break the parasite life cycle. 3. Bacterial Infections (Pneumonia): Veterinary Consultation:This is a medical emergency. You must contact a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. A vet will likely listen to the goat's lungs and may take its temperature. The veterinarian will prescribe an antibiotic based on the specific bacteria identified or suspected. Commonly used antibiotics for goat pneumonia include penicillin, oxytetracycline, or ceftiofur. It is crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to prevent a relapse and the development of antibiotic resistance. Or you can provide supportive care, such as providing a warm, dry, and well-ventilated space for the sick goat, isolated from the rest of the herd to prevent disease spread. Encourage fluid intake. Offer high-quality, easily digestible feed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed by a vet to reduce fever and inflammation, making the goat more comfortable. Ensure the goat barn has adequate airflow to prevent the buildup of dust and ammonia. Regularly clean and replace bedding to maintain a sanitary environment. Isolate any new goats for at least two weeks before introducing them to the rest of the herd. This helps prevent the spread of infectious diseases."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the age of castration for a Calf?","Final Answer":"The ideal age to castrate a bull calf is as early as possible, usually before it reaches three months of age. This recommendation is based on several key factors related to animal welfare, stress, and long-term health and growth. Calves are easier to handle when they are young, and their smaller size means the procedure is less traumatic. The younger the calf, the less developed the nerves and blood vessels are in the scrotum, which reduces the immediate pain and stress response. Studies have shown that calves castrated at a young age experience a shorter period of discomfort compared to those castrated later. Castrating a calf at an early age is considered a best practice for animal welfare. It's a less invasive procedure with a lower risk of complications like bleeding, infection, and chronic pain. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends performing castration at the earliest age possible, preferably before three months. A common misconception is that delaying castration allows the calf to benefit from testosterone and gain more weight before the procedure. However, research has shown that any testosterone advantage in young calves is minimal and does not significantly impact their final weaning weight. In fact, late castration (at or after weaning) can cause significant stress, a higher risk of sickness, and a setback in growth from which the calf may never fully recover. Calves castrated early often have higher average daily gains in the post-weaning period. Castrated male calves (steers) are often more valuable at auction than intact bulls. Buyers prefer steers because they are less aggressive, easier to manage in a feedlot, and produce a higher-quality carcass with better marbling and tenderness. The appropriate age also depends on the castration method. Surgical Castration: This method involves the surgical removal of the testicles. It is suitable for calves of various ages, but is generally recommended for calves under 6 months of age. The procedure is easier and safer in younger animals. Burdizzo (Emasculator): This is a bloodless method that crushes the spermatic cords. It is typically used on older calves, often from around 3 to 6 months of age, as it requires the ability to easily palpate the cords. For the best welfare and economic outcomes, the castration period for a calf should be as early as possible, with the first 1-3 months of life being the ideal window."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me information regarding repeat breeding?","Final Answer":"Repeat breeding is a major reproductive problem in cattle and buffalo, which also affects livestock farming. It refers to a cow or buffalo that has regular estrous (heat) cycles but fails to conceive after three or more consecutive inseminations with fertile semen. This condition is a significant cause of economic loss for farmers because it extends the calving interval, reduces milk production, increases the cost of breeding, and can lead to the culling of valuable animals. The causes of repeat breeding are complex and often a combination of factors. In a region like Arunachal Pradesh, which has diverse topography and specific agricultural practices, these factors can be particularly challenging. Improper Breeding Management: Farmers may fail to identify the signs of a cow in heat (estrus) or miss the optimal time for insemination. This is especially true in buffaloes, which exhibit silent or weak heat signs. The skill of the inseminator and the proper handling of frozen semen straws are critical. In rural areas, a lack of trained personnel can be a contributing factor. Using semen that has not been properly stored (i.e., cold chain not maintained) or is of poor quality can lead to fertilization failure. A lack of essential minerals (e.g., phosphorus, copper, zinc) and vitamins (especially A, E, and D) can impair the animal's reproductive system. After calving, high-producing cows may not consume enough food to meet their energy needs for milk production. This \"negative energy balance\" can delay the return to normal cycles and affect fertility. Subclinical endometritis (inflammation of the uterus) is a common cause of repeat breeding. The infection may not cause visible symptoms like vaginal discharge, but it can lead to early embryonic death. Bacteria, viruses, or even fungi can be responsible. Controlling repeat breeding in cows and buffaloes requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various underlying causes. Here's a comprehensive plan focusing on management, nutrition, and veterinary intervention. Improve Breeding and Herd Management: Accurate Heat Detection: This is the cornerstone of a successful breeding program. Train farm staff to carefully observe animals for signs of heat, which include: Standing to be mounted by other cows. Mounting other cows. Restlessness and bellowing. Swelling and redness of the vulva. Presence of a clear, thick mucus discharge. Once a cow is in heat, the \"AM\/PM rule\" is a good guideline: inseminate in the morning (AM) if signs of heat are observed the previous evening (PM), and in the evening (PM) if signs are observed in the morning (AM). Ensure the cows and buffaloes receive a diet with the correct balance of protein, energy, and fiber.  Ensure adequate levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are crucial for bone health and reproductive function. Consult with a veterinarian to identify and treat underlying health issues. Reproductive Tract Examination: For cows that are repeat breeders, have a vet perform a physical examination of the reproductive tract. This can help identify: Ovarian cysts. Anatomical defects. Signs of subclinical endometritis (uterine inflammation). Treatment of Infections: If a uterine infection is diagnosed, the vet will prescribe specific treatments, which may include: Intrauterine infusions of antibiotics. Hormonal therapies (e.g., prostaglandins) are used to cause a new cycle and help the uterus clear the infection. In cases of hormonal imbalance, a vet may administer hormones like GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) to induce ovulation or prostaglandins to bring the animal into heat. Ensure a regular deworming schedule to prevent internal parasites, which can compromise the animal's overall health and fertility. Vaccinate against reproductive diseases that can cause embryonic death or abortion. In hot climates, especially in the low-lying areas of Arunachal Pradesh, heat stress can be a significant factor. The first step is to get a professional diagnosis. They can conduct a physical exam and recommend a specific plan for your herd. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the control measures should be adapted for deteriorated water quality?","Final Answer":"Control measures for deteriorated water quality in fisheries are critical for maintaining healthy fish populations and ensuring the sustainability of the operation. These measures primarily focus on prevention and mitigation by managing the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of the water. Regular monitoring is the foundation of water quality control. By routinely checking key parameters, you can detect problems early and take corrective action before they escalate. The ideal pH for most fish is between 6.5 and 8.5. If the water is too acidic or alkaline, it can stress the fish, damage their gills, and reduce their growth. You can adjust the pH by adding agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) to acidic water or a buffer like sodium bicarbonate to highly alkaline water. Fish need sufficient DO to survive. Low DO levels are a primary cause of fish kills. Aeration is the main control measure. This can be done by using aerators, splashboards, or paddlewheels to increase the water's surface area and facilitate oxygen transfer from the air. These compounds are produced from fish waste and uneaten feed. High levels are toxic to fish. The nitrogen cycle is the biological process that breaks them down into less harmful forms. To manage this: Avoid overfeeding to reduce waste. Maintain a healthy population of beneficial bacteria through proper aeration. Use biofilters in closed systems to provide a surface for these bacteria to colonize. Extreme temperatures, whether too high or too low, can be lethal. In warm climates, you can increase water depth, provide shade, or use water exchanges to keep temperatures down. Proper pond and farm management directly influences water quality. Do not overcrowd your ponds. A high stocking density increases the amount of fish waste, which puts a strain on the water's natural filtration capacity. Overfeeding is a common cause of water quality issues. Uneaten food decomposes and consumes dissolved oxygen while increasing ammonia levels. Feed your fish only what they can consume in a short period (10-15 minutes). Regularly drain and refill a portion of the pond water. This helps flush out accumulated waste products and replenish the water with fresh, oxygenated water. Over time, waste and uneaten food form a thick layer of sludge at the bottom of the pond. Periodically, you must remove this sediment to prevent the release of harmful gases like hydrogen sulfide. Harnessing natural processes can help maintain a balanced aquatic ecosystem. Introducing beneficial microbes (probiotics) to the water or feed can help break down organic waste, improve water quality, and even enhance the fish's immune system. While some aquatic plants can be a problem, certain types can act as natural filters, absorbing nutrients like nitrates and phosphates. However, you must manage their growth to prevent them from overgrowing and consuming too much dissolved oxygen at night. Raising different species of fish in the same pond can create a more balanced ecosystem. For example, a fish that feeds on algae can help control algal blooms, which can cause oxygen depletion when they die off."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the anti-rabies vaccine?","Final Answer":"Rabies vaccination for dogs is a critical public health and animal welfare measure, as it is throughout India. The state government, in collaboration with various organizations, is actively engaged in vaccination drives and awareness programs to control and eventually eliminate rabies. For dogs, the rabies vaccine is a core vaccine, meaning it is considered essential for all dogs regardless of their lifestyle or location, especially in countries like India, where rabies is endemic. The vaccine is a preventative measure that helps a dog's immune system fight off the rabies virus if it is ever exposed. The specific vaccine used is typically an inactivated (killed) virus vaccine. This means the vaccine contains a dead form of the rabies virus that cannot cause the disease but is sufficient to trigger an immune response in the dog's body. Some common brand names for rabies vaccines for dogs available in India include Nobivac Rabies (from Merck Animal Health), Raksharab (from Indian Immunologicals), Defensor (from Zoetis), and Rabigen. The typical vaccination schedule is as follows:First Dose: Administered to puppies at around 12-16 weeks of age. Booster Dose: A second dose may be given after 21-30 days to ensure robust immunity. Annual Booster: After the initial puppy shots, an annual booster is mandatory to maintain immunity for the dog's lifetime. The cost of a rabies vaccine in India is generally affordable, ranging from \u20b9160 to \u20b9500 per dose, depending on the clinic and the brand of vaccine. It is very important to get a vaccination card from the veterinarian after the first dose and to keep it updated with each subsequent booster. This card serves as proof of vaccination and is essential for travel or in case of a bite incident. You can get your dog vaccinated against rabies at the government veterinary hospitals and dispensaries. These are the primary points of contact and are located in various districts and towns across the state. They are often the sites for free or subsidized vaccination programs. You can find information about these centers through the local Department of Animal Husbandry or district administration offices. Private Veterinary Clinics:In more urbanized areas like Itanagar and Naharlagun, private veterinary clinics also offer a range of vaccination services. NGOs and Animal Welfare Organizations: Look out for announcements from local NGOs that may be conducting vaccination camps or offering services."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me information regarding Oxygen depletion in the pond water?","Final Answer":"Pond water depletion is a growing concern for fisheries, agriculture, and local communities. The issue is multifaceted, stemming from both natural and anthropogenic factors. As a state with rich natural water resources, highly dependent on its rivers, streams, and ponds, but these resources are increasingly under threat. Causes of pond water depletion are the most significant factor is the change in weather patterns. Arunachal Pradesh is experiencing erratic rainfall, with shorter monsoon seasons and longer, drier periods. This leads to reduced surface water recharge, causing ponds and other water bodies to dry up, especially during the lean seasons. A study in the Namsai district has shown that seasonal variations, along with climate change, have a noticeable impact on the quality and quantity of spring water, which feeds many local ponds, deforestation and land use change, Unregulated logging and mining activities, particularly in districts like Changlang, have led to severe deforestation, the shift towards more intensive and commercial farming, including fish farming, increases the demand for water for irrigation and pond management. The depletion of pond water has a severe impact on the fisheries sector, which is a key source of protein and livelihood for a large portion of the population, such as Reduced Fish Production, a rapid decrease in water volume can lead to a corresponding increase in the concentration of toxins (like ammonia) and a drop in dissolved oxygen, causing stress and mass fish mortality, for fish farmers, pond water depletion means a loss of their entire stock and a significant financial setback. This can undermine the viability of commercial fish farming and discourage new farmers from entering the sector. Controlling pond water depletion is a multi-faceted challenge that requires a combination of structural, biological, and management-based solutions. The goal is to maximize water retention, reduce loss, and ensure the long-term health and productivity of the pond such as Reducing Water seepage through the pond bottom is often the primary reason for water depletion, especially in areas with permeable soil. The most effective solution is to install a waterproof liner. This can be a flexible plastic membrane (like PVC or EPDM) or a compacted layer of clay. Reducing Water Loss from Evaporation and Transpiration, constructing ponds that are deeper with a smaller surface area can significantly reduce water loss through evaporation. Planting trees around the pond (but not too close to avoid leaf litter buildup) can provide shade, which cools the water and reduces evaporation. While a balanced ecosystem is good, an overgrowth of aquatic plants can lead to a significant loss of water through a process called transpiration. Managing plant growth is important to avoid this.. Improving Water Inflow and Management: Implement a system to divert rainwater runoff from the surrounding land into the pond. This can be done by creating small channels or drains. Over time, silt and sediment from runoff build up at the bottom of the pond. Regularly desilting the pond (especially during the dry season when it is empty) will restore its original depth and water-holding capacity. A high density of fish and other organisms puts a strain on the pond's ecosystem and can increase the buildup of organic waste, which consumes water and oxygen. Regularly check the pond's banks and dikes for leaks or cracks. Repairing these promptly can prevent significant water loss."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"From where can I get Japanese Quail?","Final Answer":"Availability of Japanese quail can be challenging due to the specialized nature of the farming. Japanese quails are a popular and low-investment option for small-scale poultry farmers across India. You can get Japanese quail by contacting your local Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services: the District Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Officer (DVO), is the best starting point. This government department is responsible for promoting and supporting livestock and poultry farming in the region. They often have programs to introduce new poultry species, provide training, and may be aware of any local farmers or organizations involved in quail farming. They can also provide guidance on sourcing birds or hatching eggs from outside the district. Your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK): The Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in West Kameng, located in Dirang, is a farm science center that provides agricultural and animal husbandry-related information and training to farmers. KVKs often run demonstration projects and can connect you with successful farmers who might be raising Japanese quails. They can also provide technical knowledge on how to start and manage your own quail farm. Check with Local Farmers and Markets:Visit local markets in major towns like Bomdila, Dirang, or Rupa. While live birds may not always be available, the vendors might be able to tell you where they source their quail eggs or meat from, which could lead you to a local breeder. If you cannot find a local supplier, you may need to look for sources in neighboring districts or states with better connectivity and a more developed poultry industry. Guwahati, Assam:Guwahati, being a major hub in the Northeast, has several poultry farms and suppliers who deal in Japanese quails and hatching eggs. You can use online directories like Justdial to find suppliers in Guwahati who may be able to arrange transport to Arunachal Pradesh. Join online groups and forums for poultry farmers in Northeast India. These platforms are great for connecting with other farmers and learning about suppliers."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What to feed carp?","Final Answer":"Feeding carp, whether in ponds or through integrated systems like paddy-cum-fish culture, is a combination of utilizing natural productivity and providing supplementary feed. The Department of Fisheries, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, provides specific guidance on these practices to help farmers achieve optimal fish growth. The natural food available in a pond is crucial for the early growth of fish, especially fry and fingerlings. Microscopic plant organisms. Zooplankton: Microscopic animal organisms. Benthic organisms: Insects, worms, and other small invertebrates living at the bottom. Detritus: Decaying organic matter. To ensure a continuous supply of this natural food, you need to fertilize the pond. The Department of Fisheries recommends a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Organic Manure: Raw cattle dung, poultry litter, or pig manure are excellent sources. A recommended dose is about 600 to 800 kg per 1000 square meters of water area, applied in split doses throughout the year. This promotes the growth of the microorganisms that carp feed on. Inorganic Fertilizers: Urea, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash can be applied in monthly doses, alternating with organic manure. While natural food is important, it's often not enough to support a high stocking density, especially as the fish grow. Supplementary feeding is necessary to achieve faster growth and a better yield. The most common and locally available ingredients for carp feed are: Rice Bran: A byproduct of rice milling, rich in carbohydrates. Mustard Oil Cake: A byproduct of mustard oil extraction, providing protein. Groundnut Oil Cake or Soybean Meal: These are excellent sources of high-quality protein. A simple and effective supplementary feed can be prepared by mixing rice bran and mustard oil cake in a ratio of 1:1. The feed should be given at one or two fixed points in the pond to avoid wastage and prevent pollution. It can be placed in perforated plastic bags or on a bamboo tray and submerged in the water. The Apatani plateau in Arunachal Pradesh is famous for its paddy-cum-fish culture, a highly sustainable and traditional practice. In this system, the fish (primarily common carp) feed on the natural food base available in the rice fields, such as plankton and periphyton that grow on the rice stems. In such systems, the need for supplementary feeding may be reduced, but a small amount of feed or fertilizer is still recommended to maximize yield. Feed should be given daily at a rate of 2-3% of the total fish biomass in the pond, with the amount adjusted monthly."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to do deworming in calves?","Final Answer":"Deworming a calf is a crucial part of herd health management to ensure healthy growth and prevent diseases. Parasites, both internal (like roundworms, tapeworms, and liver flukes) and external, can cause significant damage to a calf's digestive system, leading to poor nutrient absorption, stunted growth, and even death. In Arunachal Pradesh, with its diverse terrain and farming practices, a strategic deworming schedule is essential. It's important to consult a local veterinarian for a specific plan tailored to your farm's conditions. Dewormers, also known as anthelmintics, are medicines that kill or expel internal parasites. They work by targeting the parasites' nervous systems or metabolisms. They come in different forms, including oral suspensions (syrups), boluses (large tablets), and pour-ons. A scheduled deworming program is more effective than treating a calf only when it shows signs of illness. A typical schedule for calves up to six months of age is:First Deworming:At 10-15 days of age. This initial dose is primarily to target roundworms (Ascaris) that can be transmitted from the mother. Subsequent Deworming: After the first dose, deworming should be done at monthly intervals until the calf is about six months old. After six months, for animals older than six months, deworming can be done twice or thrice a year, often before and after the monsoon season, as the high humidity can lead to an increase in parasite eggs in the pastures. Many deworming medicines are available in India, and they are generally available as syrups or tablets (boluses). The two most common active ingredients are:1. Albendazole: Available as both oral suspension (syrup) and bolus (tablet). It is a broad-spectrum dewormer effective against a wide range of roundworms, tapeworms, and flukes. The standard dose for calves is 5-10 mg of Albendazole per kg of body weight. For example, if a calf weighs 30 kg, you would need to give 150-300 mg of Albendazole. This can be done by using a syrup or crushing a bolus and mixing it with water. The oral suspension is often preferred for young calves as it is easier to administer. 2. Fenbendazole: Also available as a syrup, bolus, or even oral paste. It is another highly effective broad-spectrum dewormer that is considered very safe for young animals. The standard dose is 5 mg per kg of body weight. Fenbendazole is often recommended for regular deworming because of its wide safety margin. The best practice is always to consult with the District Veterinary Officer or a local veterinarian. They can provide advice specific to your farm's location and the types of parasites prevalent in the area. Deworming is only one part of parasite control. Good hygiene and pasture management are equally important. Do not overstock pastures, and ensure a clean, dry living environment for the calves."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I know the stocking density of a pond?","Final Answer":"Stocking density in pond fish culture is a crucial factor for a successful and profitable harvest. It directly impacts fish growth, health, and the overall productivity of the pond ecosystem. The optimal stocking density is not a single number; it depends on the type of fish being cultured, the management practices, and the agro-climatic zone of the state. The Department of Fisheries, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, provides specific guidelines for farmers to follow, often as part of government schemes like the 'Atma Nirbhar Matsya Palan Yojana'.  Composite fish culture, which involves culturing a combination of fish species with different feeding habits, is the recommended practice. The stocking density is directly linked to the intensity of pond management. Arunachal Pradesh has distinct zones, and the recommended stocking density varies accordingly. Based on guidelines from the Department of Fisheries and other research organizations, a general stocking density for semi-intensive composite fish culture in Arunachal Pradesh is as follows: A common recommendation is 5,000 to 10,000 fingerlings per hectare (10,000 square meters) (2,000-4,000 fingerlings per acre).  The ratio of different species is critical for balanced growth. A common ratio might be: Surface feeders (Catla, Silver Carp): 40%, Column feeders (Rohu): 30%, Bottom feeders (Mrigal, Common Carp): 30%. In systems like paddy-cum-fish culture, the stocking density is generally lower, around 6,000-8,000 fingerlings per hectare (2,428 to 3,238 fingerlings per acre), as the fish have less space and feed on a different natural food base. In pig-cum-fish or duck-cum-fish culture, the stocking density can be higher (3,440 fingerlings per acre.) as the livestock waste acts as a natural fertilizer and feed, reducing the need for other inputs. It is recommended to stock healthy, uniformly sized fingerlings (about 100 mm in size) to ensure a high survival rate and uniform growth. The pond should be properly prepared before stocking, including clearing predatory fish, liming to adjust pH, and manuring to develop a natural food base. Regular monitoring of water quality parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature is essential. High stocking densities can lead to rapid deterioration of water quality, which can be fatal to the fish. The best advice will come from a local Fishery Extension Officer or a representative from the KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra). They have specific knowledge of the local conditions and can help a farmer determine the perfect stocking density for their individual pond."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide information about Gill flukes in fish?","Final Answer":"Gill flukes are a serious problem in fish farming and can cause significant losses. If you're dealing with a gill fluke, here's what you should do, categorized into immediate actions and long-term prevention. The key to treating a gill fluke infestation is to act quickly and follow a multi-pronged approach. Gill flukes often thrive in ponds with poor water quality, high organic loads, and low oxygen levels. The first step is to improve these conditions. This may involve partial water changes and ensuring proper aeration in the pond. Remove any excess feed, dead fish, or other decaying matter from the pond. This helps in reducing the breeding ground for the parasites. Check your water's pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature. Stress from unstable water parameters can weaken the fish's immune system, making them more susceptible to parasites. A simple and effective method for small-scale infestations or for treating individual fish is to give them a salt bath. A 3-5% common salt solution for 10-15 minutes can be a good option. Potassium permanganate (KMnO\u2084) is a common disinfectant used in aquaculture. A bath treatment with a concentration of 4-6 ppm (mg per liter) for a short period (5-10 minutes) can be effective (should not be used in ponds with high organic loads (e.g., murky green water), as it will be ineffective and can cause an oxygen crash). Formalin (formaldehyde solution) is another common treatment. A pond treatment with 25 ppm of formalin, along with good aeration, can be used (formalin consumes large amounts of dissolved oxygen and should never be used without vigorous, continuous aeration during and after treatment to prevent mass fish kill from suffocation). Specialized Anti-Parasitic Medications:There are commercial anti-parasitic medications available in India that are specifically designed to combat gill and body flukes. Products containing praziquantel or other antihelminthic agents are often recommended. Look for products like \"Misha Anti Lice & Flukes\" or \"DiscusX Fluke X,\" which are specifically designed for this purpose. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and application. The best course of action is to contact a local fisheries officer or an aquatic veterinarian. They can help you with proper diagnosis, recommend the most suitable treatment for your specific situation (fish species, pond size, etc.), and guide dosages. If possible, isolate the infected fish in a separate \"hospital tank\" to prevent the spread of the parasite to the entire population. This is particularly important for high-value fish. To prevent future outbreaks, you need to implement good management practices. Never introduce new fish directly into your pond or tank. Always quarantine them in a separate tank for at least two weeks and treat them for any potential parasites. Disinfect all new equipment (nets, buckets, etc.) before introducing them to your main pond. Avoid overstocking your ponds. High stocking densities lead to stress and make fish more vulnerable to diseases. A well-balanced, high-quality diet will boost the fish's immune system, making them more resistant to parasites. Before stocking new fish, dry out the pond and apply lime at a rate of 10-15 kg per bigha (depending on the water's pH) to kill off any remaining parasites or their eggs. Gill flukes are a common problem in fish farming, but with prompt action and proper management, you can control the outbreak and protect your fish stock."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the vaccination schedule for Quail(Coiler)?","Final Answer":"In quail (coiler) farming, a systematic vaccination schedule helps protect the flock from major diseases. On the 7th day, chicks are given the Newcastle Disease (ND)\u2014Lasota vaccine through eye drops or drinking water as the first dose against Ranikhet. On the 14th day, the Infectious Bronchitis (IB) vaccine may be administered via drinking water or spray in areas where the disease is prevalent. It should only be used in areas with confirmed cross-infection risk from nearby chicken farms. By the 21st day, a booster dose of ND\u2013Lasota is given to ensure uniform immunity, followed by fowlpox vaccination at the 28th day using the wing stab method to prevent pox outbreaks in hot and humid conditions. At the 35th day, ND (R2B strain) is given through intramuscular injection to provide long-lasting protection. Between 6 and 8 weeks, if there is a disease risk, the Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) vaccine is administered through drinking water. Its routine use should be re-evaluated for quail unless specifically recommended by a local veterinarian, as the disease is a major issue mostly in chickens; it should only be used in areas with confirmed cross-infection risk from nearby chicken farms. To maintain flock health, an ND (R2B booster) is repeated every three months via intramuscular injection, ensuring sustained protection throughout the production cycle."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control malnutrition in fishes in freshwater?","Final Answer":"In freshwater fish farming, malnutrition leads to poor growth, weak immunity, low survival, and reduced production.\n Control measures mainly involve providing a balanced diet and proper management.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why is floppy soil considered problematic for crops?","Final Answer":"The Floppy soil referred to is the sandy coastal soil. The main problem with this type of soil is that it has low water-holding capacity, low organic matter, nutrient retention, and soil acidity issues. This was managed by the addition of organic matter, split fertilizer application, mulching, and selection of suitable crops. Some of the crops can be grown, such as pulses, millets, oilseeds, and some vegetables like Bhendi. Some preferred pulses are Black gram and cow pea. In Black gram, the suitable varieties are VBN 8, ADT 5, and VBN 4, which mature in 65-75 days, with a seed rate of 8-10 kg per acre and yield potential of 3-4 quintals per acre. In cow pea, suitable varieties are CO (CP) 7, VBN 1, and C 152. They sustain in a hot, dry weather climate and mature in 65-70 days with a seed rate of 8-10 kg per acre, and the yield potential is 3-4 quintals per acre. In addition, millets like Pearl Millet (Bajra) perform well in sandy soils as they tolerate drought and salinity to some extent. Varieties such as CO (Cu) 9 and Kambu Hybrid COH (Cu) 10 are suitable for maturing in 75-85 days with a seed rate of 2-3 kg per acre and a yield potential of 6-8 quintals per acre. Groundnut is another ideal oilseed crop for sandy soils, provided gypsum and organic manure are applied. Varieties like VRI 2, VRI 3, and TMV 7 mature in 105-115 days with a seed rate of 35-40 kg per acre and yield potential of 6-8 quintals per acre under good management. To enhance crop performance in sandy coastal soils, applying Farmyard Manure (FYM) @ 4\u20135 tons per acre or well-decomposed compost enriched with biofertilizers like Azospirillum or Rhizobium before sowing improves nutrient retention and soil structure.

In practical terms, this translates to approximately 115 kg of Urea, 44 kg of DAP (Di-Ammonium Phosphate), and 33 kg of MOP (Muriate of Potash). These nutrients should be applied in stages: 50% of the Nitrogen, the full dose of Phosphorus, and 50% of the Potassium should be applied as a basal dose, while the remaining quantities are to be applied during the active tillering, panicle initiation, and heading stages. The basal application includes 48 kg of Urea, 44 kg of DAP, and 17 kg of MOP, which supply 50% of Nitrogen, 100% of Phosphorus, and 50% of Potassium. The remaining nutrients are applied in three equal splits at the active tillering, panicle initiation, and heading stages. Each split includes approximately 22 kg of Urea and 6 kg of MOP, with no additional DAP, since Phosphorus is fully supplied at the basal stage. This stage-wise nutrient distribution ensures a balanced supply of nutrients throughout the crop's growth cycle and matches the recommended totals of 115 kg Urea, 44 kg DAP, and 33-35 kg MOP per acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the control measures for caterpillar infestation in Cashew?","Final Answer":"Caterpillar attacks in cashew young leaves, flower bunches, and fruits. It is caused by the Hairy caterpillar.\nDuring the early stages, when the caterpillar population is below the economic threshold level, that is, just one caterpillar in a branch it is better to remove the caterpillar rather than spraying a chemical. \nIf the population increases, spraying of insecticides like Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC at 120-150 ml per acre mixed in 200 liters of water or Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG at 80-100 grams per acre in 200 liters of water should be used. Rotate the chemicals to avoid resistance buildup. Repeat the process in 7-14 days based on severity. Make sure to follow a waiting period of 5-7 days for both insecticides to avoid contamination.\n\nAnother major pest in Cashew is the Shoot and Blossom webber. To control it, practice good cultural control such as removing and destroying affected shoots, blossoms and infested terminal portions where webs are observed, thereby disrupting the pest\u2019s life cycle. Monitor regularly for signs of webbing on fresh flushes and flowers. In the initial stages, apply 4 L neem oil soap in 200 L of water. In severe infestation, use Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC at 120-150 ml in 200 L of water or Acetamiprid 4% SL 375ml in 200 L of water per acre. The pre-harvest interval needed is 1 day for Acetamiprid to avoid contamination.\n"}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What damage is caused by Thrips and Lacewing bugs in crops and how to control them?","Final Answer":"Thrips commonly affect kharif season crops such as bhendi (okra), chilli, cotton, and groundnut. The presence of thrips can be identified by symptoms like a silvery sheen on leaf surfaces, curling of young leaves, black fecal spots on flowers and fruits, and deformed flowers or fruits, which result in poor fruit set and reduced yield. Lacewing bugs, especially the green lacewing, are beneficial predators that feed on the larvae of various pests such as aphids, thrips, and small caterpillars. However, they are not typically beneficial in cashew plantations. For effective control, it is crucial to act early, when the thrips population is below 5\u201310 per plant. In this stage, install blue or white sticky traps at a rate of 50\u201360 traps per acre, and replace them every 15\u201320 days to monitor and suppress the pest population. You can also release about 4,000 first instar larvae of green lacewing bugs per acre. Avoid using systemic insecticides during this biological control stage to protect the natural enemies. If the infestation increases, apply 600 ml of neem oil mixed with 200 ml of soap solution in 200 liters of water per acre as an organic measure. When the infestation persists or becomes severe, chemical intervention may be required. Recommended insecticides include Fipronil 5% SC at 200ml per acre in 200 liters of water, Spinosad 45% SC at 60\u201370 ml per acre in 200 liters of water. Repeat the spray after 14 days, if necessary, based on monitoring."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can Brown Planthopper (BPH) be managed in paddy?","Final Answer":"Brown Plant Hoppers (BPH) in paddy cause yellowing, stunting, and significant yield loss. Apart from direct feeding damage, they also transmit viral diseases such as Rice Ragged Stunt Virus and Rice Grassy Stunt Virus, which further reduce crop productivity. Effective cultural control measures include avoiding excessive nitrogen application, maintaining proper plant spacing, and keeping shallow water levels during infestation to discourage pest buildup. For early detection and monitoring, 2\u20133 light traps or yellow sticky traps per acre can be installed along the field boundaries. If the pest population exceeds the economic threshold, begin with low-toxicity insecticides such as Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 40\u201380 grams per acre or Buprofezin 25 SC at 320 ml per acre, both diluted in 200 liters of water. It is crucial to direct the spray at the base of the tillers, where BPH usually congregates.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the effective control measure for Striga weed?","Final Answer":"Striga is a parasitic weed that severely affects crop productivity, especially in cereals like sorghum and maize. \n\nDeep ploughing during the offseason helps bury Striga seeds below their germination depth, thereby reducing their emergence. Early sowing of Kharif crops ensures vigorous crop growth, enabling the plants to better compete with Striga. \n\nEvery Striga plant must be manually removed before it flowers and sets seed. Allowing even one plant to produce seed can infest the soil for many years. \n\nAdditionally, the application of soil amendments like organic manure can improve soil health and suppress Striga infestation.\n\nAs part of Chemical control measures, a technique called herbicide seed coating can be done, as it blocks parasitism at the root zone and drastically reduces the seed bank. In this technique, crop seeds are coated with a very low dose of herbicide solution (Imazapyr or similar imidazolinone herbicides), around 40 ml per acre of seed, before sowing. When planted, the herbicide around the seedling root zone is slowly released, killing germinating Striga seedlings as they attempt to attach to crop roots. This provides season-long protection against Striga without harming the crop, since the crop is bred to tolerate low herbicide levels."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is recommended for the second spray in Cashew?","Final Answer":"It is recommended to apply insecticides and fungicides targeting common pests like tea mosquito bug, aphids, and powdery mildew as the second spray.\n\nA commonly used treatment is spraying Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 60 ml in 200  litres of water per acre or Thiamethoxam 25 WG \u2013 40 g\/acre to control sucking pests effectively. The first spraying should be done at the flowering stage, and the second spraying should be done at the fruiting stage, that is, the fruits are at the pea stage.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Emu mouth disease?","Final Answer":"Emu mouth disease is a fungal infection called Candidiasis (Thrush). Birds affected by this disease start drooling and develop small wounds inside the mouth and throat. Because of this, they cannot eat properly, become weak, and if not treated, some may even die. The first signs include excessive saliva, ulcers inside the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and reduced movement. To control the disease, keep the emu shed clean, dry, and well-ventilated. Separate sick birds promptly and wash feeders and drinkers daily to prevent rapid spread. Adding probiotics to the feed helps boost immunity and maintain gut health. If the infection is severe, immediately contact a veterinarian, and only under their guidance, use antifungal medications while observing withdrawal periods before selling meat. Provide soft feed, clean water, and vitamins to aid recovery. By observing the birds daily, maintaining a neat shed, and calling the vet on time, emus can stay healthy, grow well, and provide good profit."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control chicken viral disease?","Final Answer":"In poultry farming, the most dangerous trouble comes from viral diseases, and if TNAU advice is not followed properly, the whole flock can be lost in a few days. Among these, Ranikhet disease or Newcastle disease is the most feared because it spreads very fast through saliva, droppings, or water, and once it enters the shed, chicks start sneezing, gasping, drooping; some show green loose motion, some twist their necks, and finally, many die suddenly. In unvaccinated flocks, even 100% mortality can occur, causing farmers to lose birds, eggs, and income at once, and then face veterinary bills, disinfectant costs, government checks, and even market bans. Next, Infectious Bronchitis, which looks like a cold and cough in chickens, is very harmful as birds stop growing, lay poor-quality or misshapen eggs, and egg sales may fall. Marek\u2019s disease attacks mainly young chicks, causing paralysis in legs and wings and even tumors inside the body; birds waste away, immunity drops, and farmers have to replace the flock and spend more money. Infectious Bursal Disease, or Gumboro, kills young chicks by causing white diarrhea, swollen bursa, and weak immunity; mortality can reach 80\u201390%, and even surviving birds never grow well, resulting in major profit loss and recurring disease costs. Avian Influenza, or Bird Flu, is extremely severe, with sudden deaths, bleeding, swelling in the face and comb; the whole farm can be sealed and culled by the government, and no sale is allowed, causing heavy financial and emotional loss. These viral diseases bring big losses\u2014dead birds, poor growth, low eggs, extra medicine costs, and market restrictions\u2014and neighboring farms may also be affected. The only way to prevent them is strict vaccination following the TNAU schedule and veterinary advice. Farmers should not wait when doubts arise; they must contact the Poultry Disease Diagnosis and Surveillance Laboratory (PDDSL) at Namakkal (phone 04286-266226, mail: adl-vcri@tanuvas.org.in, or check https:\/\/www.tanuvas.ac.in\/lab_pddl.php for updated contact) or the TANUVAS Technology Centre at Madhavaram Milk Colony, Chennai. Sheds must be kept neat, visitors restricted, hands and feet washed before entry, and birds should receive probiotics, vitamins, and immunity boosters. Vaccination is the main defense since antibiotics cannot kill viruses. For example, Marek\u2019s disease is vaccinated at 0 days, Ranikhet Lasota at 5\u20137 days, Infectious Bronchitis vaccine at 10th day, and IBD live vaccine at 12\u201314 days, followed by boosters as per the schedule. Secondary bacterial problems, if any, may be treated under veterinary supervision with antibiotics like Oxytetracycline or Enrofloxacin. Vaccines and support are available at Veterinary College Namakkal, Poultry Research Station Chennai, TANUVAS hospitals, and local KVKs. By following these steps, farmers can protect their flocks from viral diseases, ensure healthy growth, prevent mortality, and secure a steady income."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is Ranikhet fever in chicks and how to manage it?","Final Answer":"Ranikhet disease, also called Newcastle disease, is a dangerous viral infection that spreads very fast in chicks, chickens, turkeys, and ducks. If birds are not vaccinated, it can even kill the entire flock. Main signs include sneezing, coughing, gasping for breath, dullness, reduced feed intake, twisting of the neck or paralysis, sudden drop in egg production in layers, watery droppings, and swelling near the eyes and neck. To prevent the disease, always keep the shed clean, dry, and airy; separate sick birds quickly; control visitors; and disinfect equipment. Giving probiotics in feed and vitamins during stress helps strengthen birds, improve gut health, and boost immunity. The most important protection is vaccination: the first dose of Lasota vaccine should be given in drinking water or by spray at 4\u20137 days, a booster at 4\u20136 weeks, and a third dose at 16\u201318 weeks for layers and breeders. Adult birds can be protected with an inactivated vaccine by injection. If secondary bacterial infections occur, a veterinarian may prescribe Oxytetracycline (10 mg\/kg) or Enrofloxacin (5 mg\/kg body weight). Medicines must always be used under veterinary guidance. Early vaccination and strict hygiene protect the flock and save money. Always buy chicks from TNAU-approved hatcheries, follow the vaccination schedule, and seek guidance from Animal Husbandry officers or the nearest KVK to ensure safe and profitable poultry farming."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why do Lac insects sometimes fail to produce sufficient resin?","Final Answer":"A single lac insect produces a small amount of resin, approximately 0.003-0.005 grams each. If lac insects may fail to produce sufficient resin due to several reasons. The most common reason is poor host plant selection, as these insects thrive best on specific trees like kusum, palash, ber, or peepal. Unsuitable host plants significantly reduce resin secretion. Extreme weather conditions also affect production, with temperatures above 40\u00b0C or below 10\u00b0C disrupting insect activity. Pest infestations pose another challenge, as beetles, moths, and parasitic wasps often prey on lac insects. Overcrowding of insects on branches leads to resource competition, etc. To improve lac production, you have to do proper host tree selection, like kusum and palash trees, which are considered ideal hosts for optimal resin yield. Regular pest control measures should be implemented, including neem oil (100 ml\/acre) sprays or diluted malathion (0.05%, 200-250 ml\/acre) applications with a 7-10 day interval period. Manual removal of infected branches helps maintain colony health. Maintaining proper insect density is important, with 1,500-2,000 insects per 30 cm branch being optimal. Harvest timing significantly impacts yield, with brood lac requiring 6-8 months of maturation and arani lac needing 3-4 months before harvest."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to cultivate Elaichi (Cardamom)?","Final Answer":"Your region is not naturally suitable for elaichi in the summer season due to its climatic requirements.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the process of making biodiesel?","Final Answer":"Biodiesel is a renewable fuel made from natural sources such as vegetable oils, animal fats, or used cooking oil. The primary process used to produce biodiesel is called transesterification. In this process, the oil or fat is reacted with methanol in the presence of a catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. This chemical reaction breaks down the triglycerides in the oil into methyl esters (which are biodiesel) and glycerin (a by-product). After the reaction, the mixture is settled to separate the biodiesel and glycerin. The biodiesel is then washed with water to remove impurities and dried to eliminate moisture. Separated biodiesel is used in diesel engines either alone or blended with petroleum diesel, offering a cleaner and more sustainable alternative. Requires basic equipment such as a reactor tank for mixing, a separation tank, a washing unit, and a drying system. It\u2019s important to follow proper safety precautions, as methanol is highly flammable and toxic, and the catalysts used are caustic."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are Biological units in Agriculture?","Final Answer":"Biological units are the backbone of agriculture, which is defined as any living organism that plays a crucial role in farming systems, contributing to productivity, sustainability, and ecological balance. These units can include plants, animals, microorganisms, and even integrated systems like agroecosystems. There are several types of biological units in agriculture, like plants (crops), which are primary producers that convert sunlight into biomass through photosynthesis. For example, cereals (wheat, rice, and maize), legumes (soybeans and pulses), vegetables, fruits, and cash crops (cotton and sugarcane). This helps in food production and improves soil fertility. Legumes fix nitrogen. Animals (livestock) are the secondary producers that convert plant biomass into animal products, e.g., cattle, poultry, sheep, goats, pigs, and fish (in aquaculture). These provide meat, milk, eggs, wool, and leather. After that, microorganisms (soil & plant microbiome) play a role in decomposers & symbionts, which enhance nutrient cycling and plant health, e.g., bacteria (Rhizobium \u2013 nitrogen fixation, Pseudomonas \u2013 biocontrol). Fungi (mycorrhizae \u2013 nutrient uptake, Trichoderma \u2013 pathogen suppression). Also, pollinators & beneficial insects are there, which control pests as well as help in pollination. Agroecosystems (integrated biological units) are like farming systems combining crops, livestock, and trees. Biological units are mainly used in sustainable production, nutrient cycling, pest & disease management, and economic benefits. You have to do management of biological units by doing crop rotation, using integrated pest management (IPM), organic farming, etc. Future prospects of the biological unit are to use biofertilizers & biostimulants, and also to do precision agriculture farming, where genetic improvements are also an important part."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide information about the cultivation and care of Coconut plants?","Final Answer":"Coconut is traditionally a tropical, coastal crop that thrives in high humidity, sandy soil, and heavy rainfall. In your location a semi-arid climate with hotter summers, lower humidity, and medium-to-heavy soils, cultivating coconuts in a semi-arid climate is possible if you follow specific care guidelines. The most crucial factor will be water, so you must plan for a reliable irrigation system. Instead of traditional tall varieties, choose hybrids like Kera Sankara or Chandra Sankara for high yield, or dwarf varieties such as Chowghat Orange Dwarf for tender coconut water. Before planting, dig large pits (1m x 1m x 1m) and backfill them with a mix of topsoil, 25-30 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM), 1-2 kg of Neem Cake, and 1 kg of Single Super Phosphate (SSP) to prepare the soil.\u00a0 Plant the seedlings during the monsoon (June-July) or in January-February if you have irrigation. For spacing, use 7.5m x 7.5m for hybrids and 6m x 6m for dwarfs. Watering is critical: young plants need 20-30 litres twice a week, and mature trees 50-60 litres every 4-5 days, especially during flowering and nut development. Follow the recommended fertilization schedule with FYM @ 10-15 kg per plant in the first year, Urea @ 200g per plant, SSP @ 500 g per plant, and MOP @ 300g per plant. Increase the amounts annually. Common pests in coconuts are the Rhinoceros Beetle, the Eriophyid Mite, and the Red Palm Weevil. Common pests are Root Wilt and Bud Rot. With proper care, dwarf varieties can yield their first crop in 4-5 years, producing 80-100 nuts per tree annually, while hybrids may take 6-8 years and yield slightly less."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the purity percentage of Magnesse Sulphate (MNSO4)?","Final Answer":"Commercial Manganese Sulphate (MnSO\u2084) used in agriculture (as a micronutrient) contains 30\u201332% manganese (Mn) and is usually a 98% pure product with the rest being water of crystallization. You can check the purity of Manganese Sulphate (MnSO\u2084) by doing lab testing, sending samples to local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or soil testing labs, or asking for CoA (Certificate of Analysis) from the manufacturer. Purity is very important to check before purchasing because lower purity (\u226495%), more impurities (heavy metals, insolubles), soil toxicity risk, higher purity (98\u201399%), better solubility, and faster plant uptake. For grapes, give a foliar spray @ 500g\/acre in 200L water to correct Mn deficiency (interveinal chlorosis). For banana, give soil Application @ 2\u20133 kg\/acre, which helps in improving bunch weight. For sugarcane, give fertigation @3\u20135 kg\/acre to help enhance sugar content. Always dissolve MnSO\u2084 in water first for foliar sprays. Avoid mixing with phosphatic fertilizers (forms insoluble compounds)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which culture should I use for composting?","Final Answer":"Composting is a natural process where organic waste decomposes into nutrient-rich humus with the help of microorganisms. Different cultures (microbes) are used to speed up decomposition and improve compost quality. Some important microorganisms play an important role in composting, like cow dung slurry, which is an effective and rich source of microbes; buttermilk or jaggery solution, which acts as a quick food source to multiply the native microbes in the compost pile; and bacteria (most active in early stages). Mesophilic bacteria (25-40\u00b0C), which break down simple sugars, proteins, and carbohydrates (e.g., Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens). After that, fungi are the main part, which break down tough materials and decompose lignin and cellulose in plant matter. Ex. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma, and White Rot Fungi (specialized for lignin breakdown), which are useful for composting woody materials, e.g., Phanerochaete chrysosporium. After this vermicomposting culture (using worms), worms ingest organic matter, and their gut microbes (bacteria & fungi) further break it down into rich castings."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the process of making compost?","Final Answer":"Composting is the natural process of decomposing organic materials such as crop residues, animal waste, and selected municipal and industrial wastes through the activity of microorganisms under controlled conditions. This process results in the formation of compost, a nutrient-rich substance that significantly enhances soil fertility and structure. Compost is broadly classified into types such as farm compost, derived from agricultural waste, and town compost, produced from urban refuse. These two vary in their nutrient content. The process of compost making is methodical and involves several stages. Typically, composting is carried out in pits of varying sizes, depending on the availability and volume of waste material. A layer of organic waste is first laid in the pit, moistened with 5\u201310 kg of cow dung in 2.5 to 5.0 litres of water, and uniformly sprinkled with 0.5\u20131.0 kg of fine bone meal. Subsequent layers are added in the same manner until the material reaches approximately 0.75 metres above ground level. The filled pit is then covered with wet mud and left for 8 to 10 weeks for well decomposition. Then, the plaster is removed, the material is moistened again, given a turning for aeration, and shaped into a rectangular heap under a shaded area, where it continues to decompose until ready for use. Compost improves the soil in multiple ways. Physically, it enhances aeration, water retention, and soil structure. Chemically, it enriches the soil with essential macro- and micronutrients. Biologically, it supports microbial activity, which is vital for nutrients and soil health."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Congress grass (Gajar ghas)?","Final Answer":"Congress grass, also known as Parthenium hysterophorus, is an invasive weed. In India, it is locally called gajar ghas, carrot grass, or white top. It spreads rapidly, competes with crops for nutrients and water, and can cause skin allergies and respiratory issues in humans and livestock.To control this weed, Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices should be followed. Mechanical\/manual control: Manual uprooting before flowering is effective \u2014 do this at the rosette stage to prevent seed spread. Avoid uprooting after seeding, as it can worsen infestation. Cutting plants above ground provides temporary control but may not be sufficient for long-term management, since new shoots emerge quickly. Cultural control: Crop rotation with marigolds during the rainy season can effectively reduce Parthenium infestations in cultivated areas. Biological control: The Mexican leaf beetle feeds on Parthenium and can significantly reduce its spread. Chemical control: Spray herbicides such as Glyphosate 41% SL (1.0\u20131.5 L per acre) or Paraquat 24% SL (1.0 L per acre in 200 L of water). Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide that kills all plants and must only be used on fallow land or for spot applications."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the effective methods to control weeds in Ladyfinger (Okra) after sowing?","Final Answer":"Controlling weeds in a ladyfinger (okra\/Bhindi) crop after sowing is very crucial to prevent competition for nutrients, water, and sunlight.

Combine manual and chemical methods for best results."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the symptoms of copper deficiency in crops?","Final Answer":"Copper deficiency is common in sandy or highly leached soil. Black cotton soils usually have moderate copper levels, but imbalanced use of fertilizers or continuous cereal cropping can reduce availability. High pH soils (alkaline) may also cause copper to become unavailable to plants. To identify the copper deficiency, observe young and new leaves because it appears first in new leaves that turn pale or yellowish green; leaves look dull; leaf tips twist and whiten or dry from the top in cereal crops; your plants may produce fewer flowers and fruits; poor grain filling; and gummosis in fruit crops. To control copper deficiency in crops, give a foliar spray of copper sulfate (CuSO\u2084) at 2 g\/liter to neutralize the solution. You can add an equal amount of lime to prevent the acidic copper sulfate from burning the tender leaves. Or give a soil application of copper sulfate at 5-10 kg\/acre based on a soil test report, as excessive copper can become toxic to the soil and plants over time."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the function of Ethrel GR?","Final Answer":"Ethephon (trade name: Etherel GR) is a granular plant growth regulator. However, in India, including Maharashtra, granular ethephon is not commonly recommended for the main commercial uses like ripening and flowering induction, which are usually done with the liquid Etherel form as a foliar spray. Etherel GR granules are sometimes used in specific crops and experimental trials where soil or localised application is preferred, because they slowly release ethylene gas into plant tissues via root uptake. Liquid formulation widely used in Maharashtra for crops like mango, pineapple, tomato, chilli, cotton, and grapes to promote or regulate flowering, fruit ripening, and uniform maturity. When applied, Etherel releases ethylene gas inside plant tissues, which triggers physiological processes such as ripening, abscission, or flowering, depending on the crop and growth stage. It is used for Uniform fruit ripening, e.g., in mango, tomato, and pineapple. Early and synchronised flowering, e.g., in pineapple and certain ornamentals. Breaking dormancy, e.g., in potatoes for sprouting. Thinning excess flowers or fruits to improve fruit size and quality. Reducing plant height in crops like cotton to control lodging. You can use it at the time of Mango Pre-harvest (Sept\u2013Oct) for flowering induction in the offseason (in some regions). Tomato & Chilli 7\u201310 days before planned harvest for uniform ripening.

Wear gloves and a mask while handling. Always take pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) Mango - 21 days, Tomato & Chilli - 7 days, Pineapple -21 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How does excess water affect Tobacco cultivation?","Final Answer":"Excess water in tobacco cultivation can cause significant damage to the plants. When soil becomes waterlogged, the roots suffer from oxygen deprivation, leading to root rot and decay. This condition also washes away essential nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and calcium, resulting in deficiencies that weaken the plants. Stunted growth commonly occurs as the damaged roots cannot properly support plant development. The moist environment encourages fungal diseases such as black shank and bacterial wilt, which can destroy entire fields. Leaves may turn yellow due to poor nutrient absorption, and the overall leaf quality deteriorates, producing thin leaves, etc. To prevent water-related issues, proper field selection is important. Avoid low-lying areas with poor drainage and instead choose well-drained sandy loam soils with a pH between 5.8 and 6.5. Planting tobacco on raised beds about 15-20 cm. Maintaining spacing of 60-90 cm between rows and incorporating organic matter like compost or planting cover crops such as clover can enhance soil structure and water management without causing waterlogging. Also, you should install open ditches or subsurface tile drains to remove excess water efficiently. Applying fungicides like copper oxychloride 50% WP (3-4 gm\/lit., 1 kg\/acre) or metalaxyl 8% + mancozeb 64% WP @ 2.5 g\/Lwith an 8-10 day interval period. Can control potential fungal outbreaks.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Fruit Dropping in Lemon plants?","Final Answer":"Fruit dropping in lemon trees during the Zaid season is mainly caused by water stress and a lack of key nutrients. Firstly, maintain consistent moisture in the soil by giving regular irrigation in the tree basin. Spray a plant growth regulator like Planofix (NAA) at a very precise dose of 1.5 ml mixed in 4.5 litres of water(pea-sized). For better fruit health and retention, it is also highly beneficial to spray a mix of zinc sulfate (3 gm\/litre of water + lime @1.5 g\/lit). These combined methods significantly reduce fruit dropping as well as increase your final harvest and income."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the role and function of GA\u2083 (Gibberellic Acid) in crops?","Final Answer":"Gibberellic Acid (GA3) is a naturally occurring plant hormone that acts as a powerful Plant Growth Regulator (PGR). It controls crucial developmental processes within the plant. In agriculture, it is used commercially as a product (usually a powder or liquid concentrate) to manipulate plant growth in a way that enhances yield and quality. Its primary role is to promote the elongation of cells, leading to longer stems and stalks. This is often seen as rapid vertical growth. It can break the natural resting state (dormancy) of seeds, buds, and tubers, leading to faster and more uniform sprouting. It can encourage flowering, especially in plants that require specific day lengths (long-day plants) or cold periods to flower. By stimulating cell division and elongation, it significantly helps in increasing the size and weight of the fruit. Helps in the transition of flowers into fruit, reducing flower and young fruit drop. In some crops, such as citrus, it can delay the ageing and yellowing of the rind, allowing the fruit to remain on the tree longer and thus extending the harvest period. When used correctly, GA3 provides several tangible benefits to farmers, such as increased yield, enhanced quality, and uniform germination. Dosage is extremely important, as too much GA3 can cause negative effects like weak, spindly growth. For crops like grapes, to increase bunch length and berry size at 25 - 50 PPM, apply at pre-bloom and post-fruit set stages. Cotton\u2014To improve boll setting and retention at 20-30 PPM at the peak flowering stage. Tomato\/Brinjal\u2014To increase fruit set and size, at 10-25 PPM, spray at the full bloom stage. Paddy (Rice)\u2014To promote early seedling growth, 10 - 20 ppm is used in nursery beds 15 days before transplanting. Sugarcane\u2014To increase stalk length and yield, at 75-100 PPM, spray on the crop around 90-120 days after planting. Potato: To break seed tuber dormancy at 1-2 PPM, dip seed potatoes in the solution before planting for 15-20 minutes. Understanding Dosage in PPM (Parts Per Million): The concentration of GA3 is measured in PPM. This is a very small unit. 1 PPM = 1 milligram (mg) of GA3 dissolved in 1 liter of water. To make a 10 PPM solution: Dissolve 1 gram of GA3 in 100 litres of water (1000 mg \/ 100 L = 10 mg\/L = 10 PPM). To make a 50 PPM solution: Dissolve 1 gram of GA3 in 20 litres of water (1000 mg \/ 20 L = 50 mg\/L = 50 PPM). Spray during the cool hours of the day, either early in the morning or late in the evening, to prevent rapid evaporation and ensure maximum absorption by the leaves."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the important care and management practices for Hasta Bahar (Pomegranate off-season flowering)?","Final Answer":"Hasta Bahar refers to the flowering season of citrus crops, mainly oranges, which occurs around September-October. This season is important because the fruits mature by April-May, when market prices are high. To manage it effectively, irrigation is stopped for 30-40 days before flowering to create moisture stress that encourages flower bud formation. During this period, pruning and fertilizer application are avoided. Once leaf wilting is seen, irrigation is resumed to promote uniform flowering. After flowering starts, fertilizers are applied per tree-Urea (1000 g), Single Super Phosphate 1500 g), Muriate of Potash (400\u2013500 g), and FYM (20-25 kg). For micronutrients, foliar sprays of Zinc Sulphate (5 ml\/litre), Magnesium Sulphate (5 ml\/litre), and Boron (2 ml\/litre) are recommended, with a waiting period of 7 days. Regular irrigation every 10-15 days and mulching help retain moisture. For pest and disease control: spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL (0.3 ml\/liter) for leaf miner (waiting period: 7\u201310 days); Fipronil 5 SC (1 ml\/liter) for aphids and thrips (waiting period: 21 days); and Copper Oxychloride (3 g\/liter) + Streptocycline (1 g\/10 liters) for citrus canker (waiting period: 14 days). For dieback, prune affected branches and spray either Mancozeb 75 WP (2.5 g\/liter, waiting period: 7-10 days) or Propiconazole 25 EC (1 ml\/4 litre, waiting period: 10\u201314 days). To reduce fruit drop, spray NAA (1 ml\/litre, waiting period: 7 days) or 2,4-D (1 ml\/litre, waiting period: 14 days) after fruit set. With proper irrigation, nutrition, and plant protection, Hasta Bahar results in high-quality fruits and better income for citrus growers."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are herbicides, and why are they used in crops?","Final Answer":"Herbicides are chemical substances used to control or eliminate weeds that compete with crops for nutrients, water, sunlight, and space, which ultimately reduces yields. For example, in soybeans, a commonly used pre-emergent herbicide is Pendimethalin, applied at 1.0 to 1.5 litres per acre within 2 days of sowing. In sugarcane, Atrazine is often used as a pre-emergent at 1 to 1.2 kg per acre to control broadleaf weeds and grasses. For rice, Butachlor is used as a pre-emergent herbicide, while 2,4-D is effective as a post-emergent spray in dryland wheat fields. Herbicides can be selective (targeting specific weeds without harming the crop) or non-selective (killing all vegetation, best used before planting). They are also classified by timing: pre-emergent (before weed seeds germinate) and post-emergent (after weeds appear). Always follow recommended dosage, spray intervals, and safety guidelines to prevent crop injury and environmental harm. For best results, integrate herbicide use with manual weeding, mulching, and crop rotation; this is known as Integrated Weed Management (IWM), which ensures long-term weed control and sustainable farming."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the procedure for preparing vermicompost?","Final Answer":"If you want to prepare vermicompost, here is a simple, step-by-step method you can follow: First, choose a place & bed size, such as picking a shaded, well-drained spot near water and building a raised bed about 10 ft \u00d7 3 ft \u00d7 2 ft (or a cement pit of similar volume). Then collect semi-decomposed cow dung, around 800-1,000 kg, plus chopped dry crop residue, about 300-400 kg (or kitchen waste mixed in a small quantity), and mix and keep this pile moist for 10-15 days so it partially decomposes and cools (this protects the worms). Then do bed layering: about 2-3 inches of sand\/soil or broken bricks for drainage, then a 6-inch moist bedding of dry leaves\/straw or coir, and add alternate layers of the pretreated cow dung and crop residue until the bed is filled, sprinkling water so the mix feels like a squeezed sponge (about 60-70% moisture). Then add worms such as Eisenia fetida (red wiggler) or Eudrilus eugeniae; for one standard bed (about 1-1.5 tonnes), introduce roughly 1 kg of earthworms per 100 kg of raw material (1\u20132 kg worms per bed). You can get them from your local KVKs. After that, cover the bed with a moist gunny bag or banana leaves and keep it in the shade (ideal temp 20-30\u00b0C), stir gently once or twice a week if needed, but avoid rough turning early on. Maintain steady moisture (sprinkle water every 2-3 days in hot weather), avoid direct sunlight, and avoid adding citrus, oily, or salty wastes. If the bed smells bad, it is too wet. Add dry leaves and turn. After 20\u201325 days, do a gentle mixing for aeration (careful not to hurt worms). Vermicompost will be ready in 45\u201360 days when it is dark brown, crumbly, and odourless. Stop watering 3-4 days before harvest so worms move down, then sieve or separate worms by light exposure. You can expect about 250-350 kg of finished vermicompost per tonne of raw material. Apply 2\u20133 tonnes\/acre as a soil application or 10-15% in potting."}

While spraying, always take advice from an agri expert and always wear safety gears"}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the possible soil improvement practices for muddy or waterlogged land?","Final Answer":"Improving muddy or waterlogged land requires a step-by-step process to correct it. The first is to level the land properly to improve uniform water flow and avoid water stagnation. After levelling, install a drainage system to remove excess water from the field, which helps to stop root damage and fungal diseases. For small or medium farms, surface drains (shallow channels) or a raised bed and furrow system are cost-effective methods to allow excess water to flow out and keep root zones aerated. In areas with persistent waterlogging, constructing open ditches around field borders can also help. Next, soil amendments like gypsum can be added, especially in clayey\/mud soils, to improve soil texture and make the soil more workable. Gypsum helps in breaking down hard clods, improving aeration, and promoting better root development. In addition to gypsum, farmers should mix in coarse organic materials like rice husk, coir pith, compost, or sand to further loosen the soil and improve water infiltration. Combining land levelling, subsurface drainage for high-value crops in heavy clay soils, gypsum application, and organic amendments leads to improvement in soil structure, better crop establishment, and higher productivity in problematic muddy fields."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended spacing for brinjal in the black soils?","Final Answer":"Black soil is common and well-suited for brinjal; spacing for the rabi season should be adjusted based on the variety and soil fertility of brinjal. The ideal spacing for the rabi season for normal varieties is 60 cm x 60 cm (between rows x between plants). Using this spacing, you can get 11,111 plants per acre. For spreading\/larger and hybrid varieties, it is 75 cm x 60 cm (between rows x between plants); you can plant up to 8,888 plants per acre. This spacing helps in good aeration, suits bushy growth, and larger fruit, and is easy to harvest. With drip irrigation, you can adjust the spacing for high-density planting (HDP) up to 45 cm x 30 cm for a higher yield. It is only suitable for specific erect-growing short-duration hybrid varieties and requires intensive nutrient and water management, which can increase the risk of pest\/disease if not managed well."}

Carbendazim 50% WP or Captan Mix 2 g\/kg of seed or apply to soil at 1 g per litre of water for bed drenching. Use chemical treatment only if there's a known pest\/disease history. Prefer biologicals for long-term soil health. You can also use mulching to prevent weeds and moisture retention and to reduce soil-borne diseases."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the newly available implements for intercultural operations in crops?","Final Answer":"During the hot summer season (March-June), you can utilise both traditional and modern intercultural practices to protect crops from heat stress and water shortages while enhancing yields. For crops like green gram, black gram, sunflower, groundnut, brinjal, watermelon, and sugarcane, timely weeding is done using manual tools like khurpi or advanced implements such as tractor-mounted rotary hoes for soybean, saving time, labour, and up to \u20b92,000 per acre. You can also use herbicides like pendimethalin (1 L\/acre for groundnut) and imazethapyr (100 ml\/acre for soybean) to control weeds early. To save water and keep the soil cool, silver-black plastic mulch for vegetables and sugarcane trash mulch are popular, reducing irrigation needs by 30% and lowering soil temperature by 5-7\u00b0C. For pest and disease control, methods such as using solarisation (transparent polythene) in tomato nurseries, biological agents like Verticillium lecanii for thrips, and even agri-drones for precision spraying are gaining popularity. Water efficiency is improved with subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) under the PMKSY scheme, which gives up to 60% subsidy, and modern inputs like IFFCO Nano Urea are used to improve nutrient efficiency. Farmers also practice earthing up in crops like sugarcane after irrigation to strengthen plants, reduce weeds, and retain moisture. Post-harvest losses are reduced using solar dryers, for which subsidies are often available through government schemes, and cold storage facilities. For soil health, 5% Jeevamrut (about 500 L\/acre) is applied. Climate-resilient varieties like HHB-311 bajra and IPM-2-14 moong are helping farmers cope with summer stress. Together, these intercultural operations mixing timely weeding, mulching, moisture conservation, smart irrigation, and organic inputs are making summer farming in Ahmednagar more profitable and sustainable."}

For the summer crop, which requires irrigation and protection from heat, nursery sowing is carried out from 20 January to 10 February, transplanting from 15 February to 5 March, and harvesting starting in late March or April; shade nets (35-50%) and drip irrigation are recommended to prevent flower drop and sunscald in the summer season. In open fields, a spacing of 45 cm between plants and 60 cm between rows is ideal, while in polyhouses, a spacing of 30-45 cm between plants and 60-75 cm between rows is preferred."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What care should I take while preparing a nursery bed for vegetable crops?","Final Answer":"The major crops grown on raised seedlings in nursery beds are vegetables like tomato, brinjal, cucumber, chilli, cabbage, capsicum, papaya, citrus, and paddy, especially in regions with heavy black soils. Because it improves drainage, helps in root development, and is easy for drip irrigation. Prepare raised beds about 15-20 cm high to prevent waterlogging. Width: 1 m-1.22 m (for easy management); length: as per space. Treating raised beds before sowing is very important to ensure healthy soil, reduce pest and disease risks, and improve crop productivity. treat nursery beds, you can do first soil solarization 3-4 weeks before sowing and give organic treatment like FYM (2-3 tonnes\/acre), vermicompost (4-5 tonnes\/acre), and neem cake (200-300 kg\/acre) at the time of land preparation. You can also use mulch to prevent weeds from retaining moisture and to reduce soil-borne diseases."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which papaya varieties are suitable for cultivation?\n","Final Answer":"Farmers can grow both dioecious and gynodioecious papaya varieties depending on the market demand and climate. Popular choices include Red Lady (Taiwan 786), Pusa Nanha, Pusa Delicious, Pusa Dwarf, and Pusa Majesty. Among these, Red Lady is most preferred for its high yield (about 200-240 quintals per acre) and tolerance to Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PRSV) and some leaf curl issues. Pusa Nanha is a dwarf type, ideal for high-density planting and easier harvesting, with yields of around 150-180 quintals per acre. The seed rate for papaya is generally about 80-100 g per acre, sown in nursery beds or polybags before transplanting. Spacing varies by variety; for normal planting, 2 m \u00d7 2 m or 2.5 m \u00d7 2.5 m is common (about 800-1,100 plants\/acre), while dwarf or high-density systems can use 1.8 m \u00d7 1.8 m spacing (about 1,200 plants\/acre). Proper male-to-female plant ratios must be maintained in dioecious types for good fruit set, while gynodioecious varieties like Red Lady don\u2019t require this. Choosing varieties with disease resistance, especially against PRSV, powdery mildew, and anthracnose, helps reduce pesticide costs and maintain fruit quality."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Telya (Oil Spot disease) in Dalimb (Pomegranate)?","Final Answer":"In dalimb (pomegranate) cultivation, \u201cTelya\u201d is the farmer\u2019s common name for oil spot disease, which is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae. Symptoms of oil spot disease are small, dark brown to black spots that appear on leaves, fruits, and stems. Spots often have an oily or wet-looking margin (hence the name Telya, meaning oily). In fruits, these spots become sunken and hard, reducing market value. Severe infection causes leaf drop, fruit cracking, and yield loss. In Sangli, favourable conditions for this are hot and humid weather during monsoon and post-monsoon, dense canopy with poor air circulation, and overhead irrigation splashing water from infected to healthy plants. To manage this, you can prune and remove infected parts, burn or bury to stop spreading, improve air circulation by keeping the canopy open, and avoid water stagnation. Or give a preventive spray of copper oxychloride at 2.5-3 g per litre every 15-20 days (monsoon) and every 20-25 days (winter) during infection-prone season, or for large-scale spraying, use copper oxychloride at 1.5 kg\/acre in 500 litres of water. Use resistant varieties that show less susceptibility (e.g., Bhagawa is moderately tolerant compared to Ganesh). Avoid overhead irrigation; use drip to reduce leaf wetness."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Anthracnose in Moong (Green gram)?","Final Answer":"Anthracnose in mung (green gram) during the Rabi season is a serious fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It can spread quickly under cool, humid conditions and cause major yield losses if not identified and managed in time. Symptoms appear on leaves as small, dark brown to black spots with slightly sunken centres, often surrounded by a yellow halo. In severe cases, spots may merge, causing leaf blight; on stems & petioles, there are dark, elongated lesions that may girdle and weaken stems; on pods, sunken, dark brown to black spots are observed; seeds inside may be shrivelled or discoloured. This disease often spreads from infected seeds and plant debris, especially after rain or irrigation splashes. To control this, always use disease-free seed such as Pusa Vishal, Meha (MH-421), and IPM 2-14. 2. Treat seeds with Thiram 3 g\/kg seed. Remove and burn infected plant residues after harvest to prevent carryover. Maintain proper spacing (30 \u00d7 10 cm) for better air circulation. At the first sign of disease, give a spray of Mancozeb at 2.5 g\/liter water or Carbendazim at 1 g\/liter water. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed, alternating chemicals to prevent resistance. Do not give spray 15 days before harvesting. Always wear goggles, gloves, a full-sleeve shirt, boots, and a mask while spraying chemicals."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Red Bittle in Pumpkin?","Final Answer":"Pumpkin is a Kharif season crop. The term \u201cred beetle\u201d generally refers to two different pests depending on the crop and region, and both can cause significant losses if not managed in time. Red Pumpkin Beetle - symptoms: Adult beetles feed on leaves, flowers, and tender shoots, leaving irregular holes. They often attack seedlings, sometimes cutting them completely. Larvae feed on roots and underground stems, causing wilting. Infestation is most severe in seedlings to early vegetative stages, soon after germination, during monsoon humidity. Control measures are Cultural practices- perform deep summer ploughing and practice crop rotation, prefer early sowing (July\u2013August) in the Kharif season. Mechanical control- Use yellow sticky traps or yellow basin traps with water and a few drops of kerosene to attract and kill beetles. Protect young seedlings with net covers or row covers for the first 2-3 weeks. Botanical - Apply Azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 3 ml\/L of water. Chemical control- Malathion 50% EC: 250 ml per acre; repeat every 5-7 days, Imidacloprid 17.8% SL: 50 ml per acre; repeat every 5-7 days. These sprays effectively reduce red pumpkin beetle populations and crop damage in cucurbits."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the harvesting period of Black Pepper?","Final Answer":"You can harvest black pepper during the winter and early in the summer. Also, you should check the climatic conditions for cultivation practices. Black pepper vines usually begin flowering in May-June, and the berries take 6-8 months to mature. Farmers monitor the berries closely, as the ideal harvest time is when a few berries in a spike turn red or orange, indicating the onset of ripening. After that, the berries are plucked by hand or using sharp tools to avoid damage to the vines. But try to focus on a timely harvest because that ensures better aroma and pungency. It gives a yield of up to 2-3 kg\/plant (220-270 kg\/acre)."}

The bank's branch manager will guide them through the application process. The required documents include Aadhaar, PAN card, land records, and a bank passbook."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage fog problems on the crop?","Final Answer":"Fog is a weather phenomenon where tiny water droplets remain suspended in the air near the ground, reducing visibility and increasing humidity. While fog can provide moisture to crops, prolonged foggy conditions can lead to several agricultural problems, including disease outbreaks, delayed growth, and reduced photosynthesis. Where fungal disease like powdery mildew, downy mildew, and blight are rapidly increasing their attack. For controlling it, you can use proper Spacing & Pruning, where wider plant spacing improves air circulation, and pruning dense foliage reduces humidity buildup. Optimised irrigation to avoid overwatering; use drip irrigation instead of sprinklers. Install drainage systems to prevent waterlogging. You can use fungicides as a preventive measure, like Mancozeb (500-700gm\/acre) or Copper Oxychloride (400 - 600 gm\/acre), before foggy seasons."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the procedure for preparing Vermicompost?","Final Answer":"For vermicompost preparation, you have to first choose a place & bed size, such as pick a shaded, well-drained spot near water, build a raised bed about 10 ft x 3 ft x 2 ft (or a cement pit of similar volume). Then collect semi-decomposed cow dung around 800-1,000 kg plus chopped dry crop residue about 300-400 kg (or kitchen waste mixed in a small quantity), mix and keep this pile moist for 10-15 days so it partially decomposes and cools (this protects the worms). Then do Bed layering about 2-3 inches of sand\/soil or broken bricks for drainage, then a 6-inch moist bedding of dry leaves\/straw or coir, add alternate layers of the pretreated cow dung + crop residue until bed is filled, sprinkling water so the mix feels like a squeezed sponge (about 60-70% moisture). Then add worms such as Eisenia fetida (red wiggler) or Eudrilus eugeniae, for one standard bed (about 1-1.5 tonnes), introduce roughly 1 kg of earthworms per tonne of raw material (1-2 kg worms per bed). You can get them from your local KVKs. After that, cover the bed with a moist gunny bag or banana leaves and keep in shade (ideal temp 20-30\u00b0C), stir gently once or twice a week if needed, but avoid rough turning early on. Maintain moisture steady (sprinkle water every 2-3 days in hot weather), avoid direct sunlight, and avoid adding citrus, oily, or salty wastes. If the bed smells bad, it is too wet. Add dry leaves and turn. After 20-25 days, do a gentle mixing for aeration (careful not to hurt worms). Vermicompost will be ready in 45-60 days when it is dark brown, crumbly, and odourless. Stop watering 3-4 days before harvest so worms move down, then sieve or separate worms by light exposure. You can expect about 300-400 kg of finished vermicompost per tonne of raw material. Apply 2-3 tonnes\/acre as a soil application or 10-15% in potting.\u00a0"}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which season\/month is suitable for pruning in Grape cultivation?","Final Answer":"Grape pruning is best done twice a year. First, back pruning is typically done in March\u2013April after the harvest, and second, forward pruning is done in September\u2013October to induce the main fruiting season (before flowering, depending on the variety). Farmers grow popular varieties like Thompson Seedless (a seedless variety with a pleasant, sweet taste), Sonaka (very long and elongated, which gives them a distinctive look and good market price), and Manik Chaman (elongated and seedless, similar to Sonaka, but they have a slightly different flavour and high yield potential). Pruning should remove old, diseased, and weak canes, keeping only 8\u201310 healthy buds per cane for a better fruit set. Before pruning, you can apply 1% Bordeaux mixture (2 kg copper sulphate and 2 kg lime in 200 litres of water per acre) or, as an alternative, Copper Oxychloride 50% WP at 500 g per acre in 200 litres of water to prevent fungal infection. Make sure the water volume ensures full coverage of the vines. After pruning, apply 4\u20135 tons of FYM + 50 kg of SSP + 25 kg of MOP per acre as a basal dose immediately after forward pruning (in September-October) to support the new growth and fruiting cycle and irrigate lightly. Always disinfect pruning tools with a 0.5% Bleaching powder solution to avoid disease spread. Timely, clean pruning helps in uniform bud sprouting, better bunch quality, and higher market returns. Avoid heavy irrigation immediately after pruning to prevent shoot rot. Rotate pruning times slightly each year to balance plant vigour and yield."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"When is the best time to bury the Sunn hemp?","Final Answer":"Sunhemp (Sonburu\/Sunn Hemp\u2014Crotalaria juncea_), used as a green manure crop in the summer season, should be buried at 45\u201360 days after sowing (DAS) for optimal decomposition and nutrient release. The best time to bury sunhemp is in summer (March\u2013June), when plants are at the 50% flowering stage but before seed formation. Height 90\u2013120 cm (soft stems decompose faster). Younger plants (<40 DAS) have low biomass, and older plants (>60 DAS) develop woody stems, slowing decomposition. Steps for burying sunhemp are to cut the plants into small pieces (30\u201340 cm) using a rotavator or sickle. Then incorporate it into the soil at about 15\u201320 cm depth with a plough or tiller. You can give light watering post-burying to speed up decomposition. It requires 15\u201320 days to decompose (with moisture) before sowing the next crop. You can get the benefits of burning the sunhemp, as it adds 25\u201330 kg N\/acre (reduces urea need by 50%) and improves soil organic carbon & water retention for Kharif crops (e.g., soybean, cotton). Some recommended varieties are K-12 and SH4."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the shade-giving trees to plant?","Final Answer":"The Zaid season, also known as the summer season, spans from March to June. During this period, the weather is hot, and it is essential to select shade trees that can withstand high temperatures and provide relief from the scorching sun. They are well-suited for the Zaid season conditions and can also enhance the aesthetic appeal of the surroundings. For shade plus pest repellence, Neem is recommended. For fast-growing fodder and green manure (agroforestry), Subabul or Gliricidia are suitable choices. For very large, permanent shade, Banyan and Peepal are good options, but they have aggressive root systems that compete heavily with nearby crops and should therefore be planted on farm borders only."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended sowing time & spacing for Tobacco crop?","Final Answer":"Tobacco (is grown in Kharif\/Rabi season), cultivated as a major cash crop, but without government permission, it is an illegal crop, for this there is a government body you can contact with them and apply for a license or permission for tobacco cultivation, which is the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) or the local State Excise\/Agriculture Department. The sowing and spacing practices vary depending on the type of tobacco grown, such as Virginia, Bidi, or chewing tobacco. For nursery sowing, Virginia tobacco is planted between September and October, while it is planted at 90 cm \u00d7 60 cm, accommodating around 7,000 to 8,000 plants\/acre, which are ready in 90 to 120 days after transplanting, while Bidi tobacco is sown from August to September and requires closer spacing, at 60 cm \u00d7 45 cm, supporting a higher density of 12,000 to 15,000 plants\/acre. Chewing tobacco nurseries are prepared later, usually from October to November, where they are spaced at 60 cm \u00d7 60 cm, with 10,000 to 11,000 plants\/acre. Transplanting is done 6 to 8 weeks after sowing."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to prevent Phosphorus deficiency in Marigold?","Final Answer":"In Marigold, phosphorus deficiency can be seen when plants grow slowly, leaves turn dark green or purplish, and flowering is delayed. To prevent this, apply Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at 100\u2013150 kg per acre at the time of land preparation. If deficiency appears later in the crop, you can spray 2% DAP solution (20 g DAP in 1 litre of water) on the leaves in the morning or evening for quick recovery. Also, keep the soil slightly moist after application so that the plant can absorb phosphorus properly. This will help in healthy growth and timely flowering."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How many years does Black pepper take to start yielding?","Final Answer":"In a semi-arid climate, commercial cultivation of black pepper (Piper nigrum \/ kali mirch) is generally not recommended under open-field conditions because the crop naturally thrives in tropical, high-rainfall, high-humidity zones like the Western Ghats, coastal Maharashtra, or Kerala. In your location's hot summers, low humidity, and occasional dry spells are unsuitable for its growth without costly modifications. If you still wish to grow black pepper here, it must be done under artificially created microclimates such as shade-net houses (50\u201375% shade) or polyhouses equipped with misting\/fogging systems, regular irrigation, and humidity maintenance above 70%. Black pepper (Piper nigrum\/kali mirch) vines typically begin to bear fruit in the 3rd to 4th year after planting. These initial years focus on establishing a healthy vine structure and support system. The planting time of black pepper for the kharif season is June-July. With the start of the monsoon, the vines will mainly focus on growing and climbing the support trees (like Glyricidia or Silver Oak) for the first two years in the vegetative stage. First flowering starts from the 2nd\u20133rd year, and small, non-commercial spikes can appear. The first light harvest usually comes in the 3rd\u20134th year, giving only about 10\u201320% of the plant\u2019s full potential. From flowering to harvest, a single black pepper berry takes approximately 6 to 8 months to mature. You can take commercial harvesting from the 4th year onward. In Pune\u2019s climate, fast-yielding varieties like Panniyur-1, Subhakara, and Sreekara are well suited. Buy only registered and licensed seeds."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the suitable tonics for heat stress?","Final Answer":"In hot summer, crops can face heat stress, which leads to leaf scorching, sunburn on fruits, flower drop, and wilting. To combat this, you can use anti-stress tonics and protective sprays to help plants cope with the heat. Use sprays such as potassium silicate or silicon-based formulations (2 ml\/litre of water) to strengthen cell walls, reduce water loss, and increase heat and drought tolerance. For sunburn protection, use a Kaolin Clay spray (30-50 g\/liter of water), adjusting the amount based on fruit size and stage. Seaweed extracts can also be used as growth boosters and to reduce stress on plants at 2-5 ml\/litre of water. Panchgavya can be applied at 300 ml per 10 litres of water. Seaweed extract formulations are typically 400-500 mL per acre, and potassium silicate formulations are around 400-500 ml per acre. Spray once in the early morning or evening to avoid leaf burn. Give light, frequent irrigation during peak summer, but avoid waterlogging."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended rootstocks used in Grape cultivation?","Final Answer":"Grape rootstocks are chosen mainly to handle soil salinity, drought stress, and nematode resistance, while ensuring compatibility with commercial varieties like Thompson Seedless. Dog Ridge (Vitis champinii) is the most widely used rootstock in Sangli for Thompson Seedless due to its high drought tolerance, good salinity tolerance, and nematode resistance. 1103 Paulsen is suitable for sandy-loam soils, has fungal resistance, is resistant to Phylloxera and root rot, and is drought-tolerant, making it good for water-scarce areas and compatible with Flame Seedless varieties. 110 R (Vitis berlandieri \u00d7 V. rupestris) tolerates drought, performs well in medium-deep soils, and is suitable for light to medium black soils. SO4 (V. berlandieri \u00d7 V. riparia) is good for medium-fertility soils and has moderate drought tolerance, but is less common in Sangli and is used in balanced soils. Ramsey (Vitis champinii), with its excellent drought and salinity tolerance and nematode resistance, is a good choice where Dog Ridge is unavailable. 1613 C (V. solonis \u00d7 Othello) has moderate drought tolerance and is resistant to root-knot nematodes, so it is used in some nematode-infested vineyards. 1616 Couderc is best for high-yielding table grapes, is resistant to nematodes and lime-induced chlorosis, is moderately vigorous, and is good for dense planting. Among these, Dogridge is the most popular due to its nematode resistance and adaptability to heavy black soils, while 1103 Paulsen is gaining popularity for its disease resistance."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Black Spots in Pomegranate?","Final Answer":"Fruit black spots are most commonly seen in pomegranates and are caused by the fungus Alternaria alternata. Small, circular to irregular black spots can be observed on the fruits; the spots are typically dry and may sometimes show faint concentric rings. In advanced stages, fruits may crack and rot. To control this, you can prune crops for better air circulation and remove and burn infected plant debris. Spray with copper oxychloride at 3 g\/liter or mancozeb at 2-2.5 g\/liter, or use carbendazim at 0.1% (1 g\/liter) or tebuconazole at 0.05% (0.5 ml\/liter) alternately. Avoid overhead irrigation to keep fruits dry. Always spray in the morning or evening for better absorption. Make sure to maintain the pre-harvest interval for food safety. Use antibiotic sprays only after confirming with the local agriculture department, as their use is regulated. Always wear gloves, a mask, and protective clothing when spraying chemicals."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which companies sell organic sulphur leaf extract bases?","Final Answer":"Organic sulphur-based agricultural inputs such as sulphur-solubilizing bacterial extracts, liquid sulphur formulations for foliar application, and granular sulphur fertilizers are commonly available. Although specific \"sulphur leaf extract-based\" products may not be widely marketed under that exact name, equivalent organic sulphur formulations effectively enhance crop nutrition and support sustainable farming practices.

Soil Application (for fruit crops like grapes, pomegranate, and banana): 4 kg Biola (powder) or 2 liters (liquid) per acre. Mix the Biola with 50 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, apply near the root zone during field preparation or at the start of active growth, and keep the soil moist for at least 5\u20137 days after application to help bacteria multiply. Or for drip irrigation (for orchards with drip systems), use 500 ml of Biola (liquid) per acre, dilute in 100\u2013200 liters of water, and inject through the drip system early morning or late afternoon. For the Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) in Biola to survive, multiply, and be effective, the soil must have sufficient moisture and a good level of organic matter (like FYM or compost). Applying this biofertilizer to dry soil or soil with very low organic content will lead to poor results, as the bacteria will not be able to establish themselves."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Redding in Cotton crop?","Final Answer":"Cotton is a kharif season crop, whereas reddening is a physiological disorder in cotton plants. Where leaves, stems, and sometimes bolls turn reddish or purplish, it is often caused by stress, nutrient deficiencies, or pests. Phosphorus deficiency is the main reason for leaves reddening, as phosphorus is essential for energy transfer and root growth. Lack of phosphorus causes reddish-purple leaves. Common in cold (15\u00b0C) or waterlogged soils where phosphorus is less available. Excess water reduces oxygen in roots, limiting nutrient absorption. Also, potassium deficiency leads to yellowing, then reddish-brown leaf edges. Sulfur deficiency causes overall reddening, especially in younger leaves. Also, there are several pests or diseases, like aphids, spider mites, or fungal infections, that can trigger reddening. Also, there are genetic factors, like some cotton varieties naturally turning red under stress. for controlling test soil for phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur before planting. Apply phosphorus-rich fertilizers (DAP, 150-200 kg\/acre SSP) at planting. Use foliar sprays (2% DAP or potassium phosphate). Reddening is very frequently linked to a sharp demand for magnesium during the boll development stage, which the soil cannot supply quickly enough. Therefore, for preventative foliar sprays of 1% magnesium sulfate, you can use micronutrient sprays in 1% (Zn, Mg) for controlling it if a deficiency appears. Avoid planting in very cold conditions. Also, use mulching to keep the soil warm. Apply insecticides (imidacloprid 70-80 ml\/acre with a 7-10 day interval period) or miticides if needed. Choose stress-tolerant cotton varieties like FH-114, FH-152, etc. Always take an agri expert's advice, and while spraying, use safety gear."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the use of vitamin E for plants?","Final Answer":"The primary and most critical use of vitamin E for plants is its internal function as a powerful, fat-soluble antioxidant. Plants produce their own vitamin E (in various forms called tocopherols) as a vital defence mechanism. Protecting Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis, Defending Against Environmental Stress, Seed Viability, and Germination. Healthy plants are highly efficient at synthesizing the amount of vitamin E they need. There is very little scientific evidence to suggest that spraying vitamin E on plants as a supplement provides significant, cost-effective benefits in a field or garden setting. The plant's internal regulation is far more complex and effective. In some experimental studies, spraying vitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol solution) on crops like wheat, tomato, and cucumber reduced damage from heat and salinity stress. Some trials show slightly better chlorophyll content and photosynthesis under stress when plants receive foliar vitamin E."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"There has been no Report on Soil Testing available for the past month. What should I do?","Final Answer":"The primary purpose of soil testing is to optimize fertilizer application. By knowing exact nutrient levels, farmers can avoid overuse or underuse of fertilizers, saving costs while protecting the environment. Testing also helps identify specific nutrient deficiencies that may limit crop growth and yield. Another important function is determining soil pH, which indicates whether the soil is too acidic or alkaline for optimal plant growth. Soil testing provides several benefits for agricultural operations, like improving crop productivity by revealing exactly what nutrients the soil lacks. The process helps detect harmful elements like heavy metals or excessive salts that could damage plants. Regular testing promotes sustainable farming practices by preventing nutrient runoff and soil degradation. Many farmers use soil tests to qualify for certified organic farming programs. When soil test reports are delayed by one month or more, there are several practical steps farmers can take. First, contact the testing laboratory to inquire about the status of your report. While waiting, you can apply half the normal amount of a balanced NPK fertilizer as a precaution (as a safe, precautionary measure, while you wait, you can apply a balanced basal dose of approximately one 50 kg bag of 10:26:26 NPK complex fertilizer per acre). Organic manure, like farmyard manure or compost, can be used safely during this period. Observe plants carefully for signs of nutrient deficiencies-yellow leaves may indicate a nitrogen shortage, while purple leaves often signal a phosphorus deficiency. To prevent future delays, consider submitting soil samples during less busy periods, typically avoiding the pre-monsoon rush. Choosing accredited laboratories with good reputations for timely service can help. Some private labs offer express services for urgent cases, though at higher costs."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How many years does it take for fruit production on a commercial scale?","Final Answer":"Reaching commercial-scale production means not only when a crop begins to yield but also when it achieves the breakeven point and reaches peak production, ensuring consistent profit and a reliable market supply. Short-duration vegetables like tomato, chilli, and capsicum can reach commercial scale within 1\u20132 years, as they produce full yields in the first season and allow multiple cycles annually. Cereals and pulses such as wheat, sorghum, and pigeon pea usually take 2\u20133 years to optimize practices, improve soil health, and establish strong market channels. Among fruit crops, banana and papaya become commercially viable in about 1-1.5 years, and guava in 3\u20134 years, while mango, although it starts bearing in 3\u20134 years, becomes truly profitable only after 7-10 years at peak production. Plantation crops like coconut(3-4 years in dwarfs and 7-10 years in talls) and coffee require 6-8 years to reach full returns, while floriculture crops such as marigolds, roses, and gerberas can achieve commercial scale in less than a year with proper market linkage. Regardless of crop type, long-term commercial success depends on yield stability, consistent quality, efficient infrastructure such as irrigation and storage, and secure year-round market access."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much nutrient is required for increasing the bunch size?","Final Answer":"To increase bunch size in grapes and bananas during the Zaid season, strategic nutrient management is essential. For grapes, the fertilization strategy is tailored to vine age. First-year vines should receive 46 g of nitrogen (N), 32 g of phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085), and 250 g of potassium (K\u2082O), along with FYM. As vines mature, these doses increase to 460 g N, 480 g P\u2082O\u2085, and 500 g K\u2082O in the second year, progressing to 750 g N, 640 g P\u2082O\u2085, and 1,000 g K\u2082O per vine from the third year onward. The recommended application method is to apply the full phosphorus and FYM plus half of the nitrogen and potassium immediately after pruning, followed by the remaining half 21 days later. For bananas, recommendations vary slightly by variety but generally suggest 200-250\u202fg\u202fN, 60-70\u202fg\u202fP, and 300\u202fg\u202fK per plant, applied in 3-5 split doses during the cropping cycle. Specifically, the Nendran variety benefits from 150 g N, 90 g P, and 300 g K per plant, delivered via split applications through fertigation channels."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"From where can I get Trichoderma cards?","Final Answer":"\"The Trichogramma card is a simple but powerful tool for biological pest control. It's essentially a carrier for the eggs of a tiny, beneficial insect called the Trichogramma wasp. The Trichogramma is a type of \"parasitoid\" wasp, which means it lives on and eventually kills its host. It's microscopic (about 0.5 mm) and completely harmless to humans, plants, and livestock. Its only mission is to find the eggs of other insects, primarily moths and butterflies. Trichogramma cards are highly effective against the eggs of various lepidopteran pests (moths and butterflies), which are major threats to crops. They are primarily used for controlling the pink bollworm, spotted bollworm, and American bollworm. In Soybean & Pulses, in Tur and Chana, Controlling the Gram Pod Borer. In Sugarcane Controlling Early Shoot Borer and Internode Borer. In Maize & Jowar Controlling Stem Borers. In Rice Controlling Stem Borer and Leaf Folder. And in Vegetables (Tomato, Brinjal, Okra): Controlling Fruit Borers. Trichogramma cards are a preventive measure, not a cure for heavy infestation. You must release the wasps as soon as the pest moths start appearing in your field and laying eggs. You can use 6 cards per acre for each application. You cannot rely on a single release. For effective, season-long control, you need to make 4 to 6 releases at weekly intervals. This ensures a continuous presence of the beneficial wasps in your field. You can buy them from the most reliable and primary sources for quality-assured bio-agents like Trichogramma  such as the official State Government Bio-Control Laboratories (like the one in Nagpur), which supply to districts via agriculture offices, or from your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or Buldhana Local Agri-Input Dealers (Krushi Seva Kendras).

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you give information about Wild Castor?","Final Answer":"Van Erandi (Wild Castor)-locally called Van Erandi, refers to the hardy, perennial form of Ricinus communis that grows naturally along bunds, roadsides, and wastelands. This wild type is extremely drought-tolerant and adapted to low-input conditions, but its seed yield and oil recovery are much lower than those of improved commercial castor varieties. While wild castor seeds still contain valuable castor oil (used in biofuels, lubricants, soaps, and medicinal products), the plants are generally smaller, slower to mature, and more suited for ecological or subsistence uses rather than commercial-scale farming. Use 4-5 kg of seed per acre with a spacing of 120 cm \u00d7 60 cm. Give one irrigation immediately after sowing, then at 25-30 day intervals, and again at flowering (45-50 DAS). Major pests include castor semilooper and capsule borer. Install pheromone traps and spray Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG at 80\u2013100 g per acre in 200 liters of water. Major diseases like wilt and root rot can be managed by using resistant varieties, avoiding waterlogging, and practicing crop rotation. Improved varieties mature in 120\u2013150 DAS and yield about 8\u201310 quintals\/acre under good irrigation and 5-7 quintals\/acre in rainfed conditions, with 45\u201350% oil content. If you let true Van Erandi (wild castor) grow naturally without improved seed, you will not achieve these yields; expect much lower output (often less than 2-3 quintals\/acre). For commercial purposes, always use certified improved varieties."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which species should I used for Vermicompost?","Final Answer":"Vermicomposting is the process of using earthworms to convert organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. There are some important species, like Eisenia fetida (tiger worm), which is the most popular worldwide and also tolerates a temp range of 15-25\u00b0C, which is used for household and commercial vermicomposting. Eisenia andrei (red earthworm), which is more efficient in breaking down waste, and this is used in large-scale composting; and Perionyx excavatus (Indian blue worm), which handles high moisture and fast reproduction. Overall, all these species have high reproduction rates, like doubling in 60-90 days, and also consume half of their body weight and are tolerant to pH levels of 6-8."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I prepare vermicompost and which are the ingredients required for it? ","Final Answer":"If you want to prepare vermicompost, then firstly, choose a place & bed size, such as picking a shaded, well-drained spot near water and building a raised bed about 10 ft x 3 ft x 2 ft (or a cement pit of similar volume). Then collect semi-decomposed cow dung, around 800-1,000 kg, plus chopped dry crop residue, about 300-400 kg (or kitchen waste mixed in a small quantity), and mix and keep this pile moist for 10-15 days so it partially decomposes and cools (this protects the worms). Then do bed layering: about 2-3 inches of sand\/soil or broken bricks for drainage, then a 6-inch moist bedding of dry leaves\/straw or coir, and add alternate layers of the pretreated cow dung and crop residue until the bed is filled, sprinkling water so the mix feels like a squeezed sponge (about 60-70% moisture). Then add worms such as Eisenia fetida (red wiggler) or Eudrilus eugeniae; for one standard bed (about 1-1.5 tonnes), introduce roughly 1 kg of earthworms per 100 kg of raw material (1-2 kg of worms per bed). You can get them from your local KVKs. After that, cover the bed with a moist gunny bag or banana leaves and keep in shade (ideal temp 20-30\u00b0C), stir gently once or twice a week if needed, but avoid rough turning early on. Maintain steady moisture (sprinkle water every 2-3 days in hot weather), avoid direct sunlight, and avoid adding citrus, oily, or salty wastes. If the bed smells bad, it is too wet. Add dry leaves and turn. After 20-25 days, do a gentle mixing for aeration (careful not to hurt worms). Vermicompost will be ready in 45-60 days when it is dark brown, crumbly, and odourless. Stop watering 3-4 days before harvest so worms move down, then sieve or separate worms by light exposure. You can expect about 300-400 kg of finished vermicompost per tonne of raw material. Apply 2-3 tonnes\/acre as a soil application or 10-15% in potting."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I cut the shoots of Paddy seedlings before transplanting?","Final Answer":"Yes, you can cut back the shoots of rice seedlings before transplanting, a process known as clipping. This is a corrective measure primarily for seedlings that have become over-aged, tall, and lanky in the nursery due to delayed transplanting. Clipping is not a routine practice for healthy, correctly-aged seedlings. Its purpose is to reduce the seedling's height to prevent lodging after transplanting and to balance the overgrown shoot with the root system, which significantly reduces transplanting shock and promotes quicker establishment in the main field. The ideal time for clipping is 2-3 days before transplanting. This gives them enough time to recover before being moved. The goal is to reduce the seedling height to about 15-20 cm, removing roughly one-third of the top growth. For clipping, use a clean, sharp sickle or knife to make a clean cut. Avoid crushing the stems, as this can increase the risk of infection. Perform the clipping in the morning or evening to minimize stress on the plants. After cutting, lightly irrigate the nursery. To prevent fungal infections, you can apply a mild fungicide solution of Copper Oxychloride (0.25%). Do not cut too close to the transplanting day, as seedlings need at least 48 hours to recover and begin fresh leaf growth before they are moved to the main field."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"When is pruning done in Guava?","Final Answer":"Yes, you can do the pruning of the guava. It is highly beneficial for improving fruit quality and regulating production, disease control, and increasing yield. You can remove unwanted diseased and dry branches, which can help in encouraging new and healthy growth, regulating the flowers and fruits in season, improving the color, size, and yield of the guava, and reducing some pests and disease spreading. Guava pruning should be done every year, but how much and when depends on the variety and age of the tree. Guava pruning is dictated by the 'Bahar' treatment, the practice of inducing flowering and fruiting for a specific season. The timing of pruning is entirely dependent on which harvest the farmer is targeting. For the Mrig Bahar (monsoon flowering, for a winter harvest), pruning is done in April-May; for the Ambe Bahar (spring flowering, for a monsoon harvest), pruning is done in December-January."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I prepare fertilizer grade 23:23:00 at my farm using DAP and Urea?","Final Answer":"You can make fertilizer grade 23:23:00 in your farm using DAP and urea. First, you need to understand the content of DAP and urea, which is that DAP contains 18% nitrogen and 46% phosphorus, which makes its grade 18:46:00, and urea contains only 46% nitrogen, which makes its grade 46:00:00. To create 100 kg of 23:23:00, which contains 23% nitrogen, 23% phosphorus, and some nitrogen. You need to mix the 50 kg DAP, which gives you 23% phosphorus, and 30.5 kg urea, which gives the remaining nitrogen to complete the 23%, and 15 kg filler material (sand, soil, or dolomite powder). Mix these fertilizers only for the amount required and for immediate use. Do not mix and store them for a long time. Wear appropriate safety gear such as a mask, gloves, full-sleeve shirts, and boots while mixing the fertilizer. Make fertilizer under an expert's supervision."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I use Azotobacter mixed with Trichoderma?","Final Answer":"Azotobacter and Trichoderma can be mixed, but their interaction may vary depending on crop, soil, and environmental conditions. For best results, it is recommended to experiment on a small scale first and follow product-specific guidelines. If you want to mix, it is important to follow the correct procedure for effective results. For seed treatment, first prepare a slurry by mixing 4-5 grams of Trichoderma powder with clean, lukewarm water. Coat 1 kg of seed evenly with this Trichoderma slurry, and allow it to dry in the shade for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. After the seeds are dry, prepare a slurry of Azotobacter culture by mixing 10-20 grams of Azotobacter with water and treating the seeds with this slurry. Use the treated seeds immediately for sowing. For soil application, take the recommended quantities of Trichoderma powder and Azotobacter culture and mix them thoroughly with sufficient Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Broadcast this mixture evenly over the field or apply it near the root zone, then water the field immediately. It is important to avoid using chemical fertilizers or fungicides immediately after applying these biofertilizers, as they may kill the beneficial microbes. This is beneficial for many crops, such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, and legumes."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to wash the spray tank?","Final Answer":"You should clean the spray tank after every use to avoid chemical residue buildup, prevent nozzle clogging, and avoid contamination when using different chemicals next time. To clean the sprayers first, always empty the tank by spraying the leftover solution in the field if it\u2019s safe. Then, fill the tank one-fourth with clean water, shake or run the sprayer for 2-5 minutes, and spray the rinse water through the nozzles. For better cleaning, you can add a cleaning agent such as washing soda, detergent, or a commercial sprayer cleaner if available. Let this cleaning solution circulate through the entire system, and spray it out again. If the chemical used was strong, allow the solution to sit for 5-10 minutes before draining. After that, rinse again with plain water to remove any remaining residue. Make sure to remove the nozzles and filters and clean them separately with a soft brush. Do not use wire or metal pins to avoid damage. After cleaning, allow the sprayer to dry and keep the lid slightly open to prevent pressure build-up or bad odours. You should always wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), especially gloves and goggles, during the cleaning process to protect yourself from chemical residues."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to get land on lease?","Final Answer":"If you are a farmer and looking for agricultural land on lease, you should know that under the Maharashtra Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, leasing of land is permitted only under certain conditions and with a proper agreement. The lease should be made in writing on stamp paper and registered with the local Talathi or Tehsildar office, mentioning details like area of land, purpose (farming, dairy, horticulture, etc.), lease period, and rent to avoid disputes. It is always better to approach the local Revenue Department (Tahsil office) or Agriculture Department for guidance on the legal process of leasing land. In some districts, land is also made available for farming activities through government schemes or cooperative societies, so you may check with the Zilla Parishad Agriculture Officer. This ensures that your farming activity is legally safe and you get proper rights of cultivation for the agreed period."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"From which book can I get information on Bee rearing?","Final Answer":"You can go through the book 'Handbook of Beekeeping' published by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Beekeeping, or bee rearing, is an excellent business that can provide you with a good income from honey and other products while also helping to increase the yield of your crops through better pollination. The most common and recommended honeybee species for rearing is Apis mellifera, also known as the European or Italian bee. These bees are preferred because they are gentle, have a high honey-yielding capacity, and are easy to manage. They adapt well to our climate and can be easily kept in modern wooden boxes called beehives. Other local bees, like the Indian bee (Apis cerana indica), can also be reared but tend to be a little more aggressive. For starting bee rearing, farmers should procure good-quality bee colonies and bee boxes from reliable sources such as the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) or agricultural universities. Bees need protection from direct sun and rain, so hives should be kept in a shady, cool, and dry place. Regular inspection of the hive is necessary to check for pests like wax moths and ants. Feeding of sugar syrup may be done during the scarcity of flowers. A single bee colony can collect honey from an area of up to 2 kilometres, so even if you don't have many flowering crops on your own land, your bees will find a way to forage. Beekeeping is a low-cost venture that provides a regular income, and you can also get financial support from government schemes to get started."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How long does it take for the first estrous cycle to occur after parturition?","Final Answer":"In cattle, the first oestrous (heat) cycle after parturition (calving) usually comes within 40 to 60 days, provided the cow is healthy and managed well. However, in some cases, especially if the cow has suffered from difficult calving, poor nutrition, or infections like metritis, the return to heat may be delayed up to 90 days or more. For good fertility, it is important to allow at least one normal heat cycle before breeding the cow again. Farmers in Maharashtra should ensure their cows receive balanced nutrition with green fodder, dry fodder, concentrate mixture, and mineral mixture, along with timely deworming and good housing conditions. Proper care of the cow during the first 2 months after calving helps the uterus recover faster and promotes early return to heat. If the cow does not show signs of heat even after 3 months of calving, it is advisable to consult the nearest veterinary doctor or Artificial Insemination (AI) technician for proper examination and treatment."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding artificial insemination","Final Answer":"Artificial Insemination (AI) is a modern and scientific method used for cattle breeding, which helps farmers improve the quality and productivity of their animals. In AI, semen from a healthy and high-yielding bull of good breed is collected, preserved, and then introduced into the reproductive tract of the cow by a trained technician, without the need for a natural mating. This method ensures better genetic improvement, reduces the risk of disease transmission, and is more economical compared to maintaining a breeding bull. AI services are available at Animal Husbandry Department centres, veterinary dispensaries, Taluka Veterinary Hospitals, and also through mobile veterinary clinics. Farmers can contact their nearest Livestock Development Officer (LDO) or Gram Sevak to avail this service. For best results, farmers should observe their cow carefully for heat signs like restlessness, bellowing, swelling of the vulva, and mucus discharge, and call the AI technician within 12\u201318 hours of heat detection. Regular deworming, good nutrition, and mineral supplementation are also very important to improve conception rates."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the 2 run engine on biogas?","Final Answer":"Running a 2-run (or two-cylinder) engine on biogas is possible, but it requires modifications and proper setup because biogas has a lower calorific value compared to petrol or diesel. Biogas - a mixture of methane (50-65%), CO\u2082 (30-40%), and small amounts of H\u2082S and water vapour. Calorific value: ~4,700 kcal\/m\u00b3 (much lower than LPG or petrol). Two types of engines: Dual Fuel Mode (Diesel + Biogas) - The diesel engine uses a small quantity of diesel for ignition (5-10% of normal diesel usage), and biogas is introduced into the air intake for power. Spark Ignition (SI) Engine (Petrol Engine - A petrol engine can run 100% on biogas after adding a carburettor for gas. Requires ignition timing adjustment and air-fuel mixture control. For 2-Cylinder Engine: Minimum biogas requirement: ~0.4-0.6 m\u00b3 per kWh. For 10 HP (2-cylinder): ~2-3 m\u00b3 biogas per hour. Power output reduces by ~20-30% on biogas alone (because of low calorific value). Good for pump sets, generators, and light machinery; needs diesel pilot injection if using a diesel engine. It must be stated that raw biogas must first be passed through an iron oxide filter to remove corrosive hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S) and a water trap to remove moisture to prevent severe engine damage."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What causes foot problems in oxen?","Final Answer":"Oxen often face foot problems, especially when used for heavy work or kept in wet, dirty conditions. A common issue is foot rot, a bacterial infection that causes swelling between the toes, a bad smell, and lameness. To treat foot rot, the affected foot should be soaked in a copper sulfate or zinc sulfate footbath, and a veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection. Another problem is overgrown hooves, which happen when oxen don\u2019t walk enough on rough ground. This causes pain and difficulty walking. Regular hoof trimming helps prevent this. Cracks or splits in the hoof can result from dry weather, injury, or poor nutrition and should be cleaned and treated with antiseptics. Laminitis is inflammation inside the hoof caused by stress or overfeeding and needs veterinary care for proper treatment. Sole abscesses occur when bacteria enter through hoof injuries, causing pus buildup. Treatment involves paring (cutting) the hoof to drain the pus, flushing the area with antiseptics, and applying a clean bandage to protect the foot. To prevent foot problems, oxen should live in clean, dry environments, receive balanced nutrition rich in minerals, and have their feet inspected and trimmed regularly. Early treatment is crucial to keep oxen healthy and able to work well."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you give me details about rearing Pigs?","Final Answer":"Pig rearing is an important and profitable type of livestock farming where pigs are raised for meat, breeding, and income. Pigs grow fast and convert their feed into body weight efficiently. They can eat a variety of foods, including kitchen and farm waste, making them easy to feed. Proper pig housing should be clean, dry, and well-ventilated to keep pigs healthy. Their diet needs to be balanced with enough carbohydrates, proteins, and minerals for good growth and reproduction. Pigs breed quickly, with a short pregnancy period of about 114 days and large litters. There are different breeds used in pig farming: indigenous breeds like Ghungroo, which are strong and better for free-range or low-input systems. Exotic breeds like Yorkshire and Landrace are suited for intensive, stall-fed systems. Good health management is very important. The most serious disease in pigs is Classical Swine Fever (CSF), which can cause heavy losses. Routine vaccination against CSF is mandatory to protect the herd. Farmers should also regularly deworm pigs and keep their environment clean to prevent other diseases. Pig farming suits small and marginal farmers because it requires low investment and gives quick returns. Additionally, pig manure can be used as organic fertilizer or for making biogas, which benefits both the farmer and the environment."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What causes soil erosion during floods?","Final Answer":"Soil erosion by flood happens when heavy rain causes rivers and streams to overflow, and fast-moving water washes away the top layer of soil. This topsoil is very important because it contains nutrients needed for growing plants. When soil is lost, the land becomes less fertile, making it hard for farmers to grow crops. Floodwater can also damage houses, roads, and trees. To stop soil erosion, farmers and communities use specific methods: agronomic measures like contour farming (ploughing along the land\u2019s slope), strip cropping (growing different crops in strips), and planting cover crops to protect the soil from washing away. Engineering measures include building structures such as check dams (small dams in streams to slow water flow), gabions (wire cages filled with stones to reduce water speed), and graded bunds (raised embankments along slopes) to control water flow and prevent soil loss. Using these methods helps keep the soil safe, supports good crop growth, and protects the environment from flood damage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How do I get rid of ectoparasites on my animals?","Final Answer":"Ectoparasites, such as ticks, lice, mites, and fleas, live on the skin or hair of livestock and can cause serious problems like irritation, blood loss, skin damage, and disease transmission. To control ectoparasites, farmers should regularly check animals for signs of infestation and keep their living areas clean and dry. Using medicated sprays, dips, pour-on solutions, or powders can help kill parasites on the animals\u2019 bodies. It is also important to clean and disinfect animal sheds, bedding, and equipment. Rotating pasture land and avoiding overcrowding can reduce the spread of parasites. In some cases, veterinary advice may be needed for proper treatment and prevention. Regular care and good hygiene are key to keeping livestock healthy and free from ectoparasites."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What causes foot pain in ox?","Final Answer":"Pain in the foot of an ox can be caused by several common problems. One of the main reasons is foot rot, a bacterial infection that leads to swelling, bad smell, and difficulty walking. Overgrown hooves can also cause pain, making it hard for the ox to walk properly. Sometimes, the ox may get wounds, cracks, or stones stuck in the hoof, which can lead to pain and infection. Walking on rough or muddy ground for long periods can also hurt their feet.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why is my buffalo sick?","Final Answer":"When a buffalo is ill, it may show signs like not eating properly, weakness, fever, less milk production, or lying down more than usual. Some common illnesses in buffaloes include fever, indigestion, foot and mouth disease, mastitis (infection in the udder), and parasite infections. A sick buffalo may also have a dull appearance, dry nose, or diarrhea. It is important to observe any changes in behavior early and give clean water, good food, and proper shelter. If the buffalo does not improve quickly, a veterinarian should be called to check and give the right treatment. Regular vaccination, deworming, and cleanliness help prevent many diseases in buffaloes. Taking good care of the animal keeps it healthy and strong."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why is my buffalo not getting pregnant after mating?","Final Answer":"If a buffalo does not become pregnant after mating, there can be several reasons. One of the most common causes is silent heat, where the buffalo is in heat but shows no clear signs, making it hard for the farmer to detect the right time for mating or artificial insemination (AI). As a result, breeding often happens at the wrong time, which lowers the chances of pregnancy. Other reasons include poor nutrition, infections, hormonal imbalance, low-quality semen, reproductive tract diseases, or fertility issues in the male. Stress, extreme weather, or poor management can also affect conception. To improve the chances of pregnancy, farmers should ensure the buffalo gets balanced nutrition, clean water, and proper care. Regular observation, possibly with the help of a vet or heat detection aids, can help spot signs of heat. If the buffalo does not conceive after repeated mating, a veterinarian must be consulted to check for silent heat, internal infections, or fertility problems. Timely heat detection, correct breeding timing, and good animal health are key to successful pregnancy in buffaloes."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is global warming and how does it affect humans?","Final Answer":"Global warming is the gradual increase in the Earth's average temperature caused mainly by the rise of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and pollution. This warming leads to many changes in the environment that affect human life. Some effects of global warming on humans include more frequent and severe heatwaves, which can cause health problems like heatstroke and dehydration. It also causes extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and storms, damaging homes and farms. Rising sea levels threaten coastal areas and can lead to loss of homes and jobs. Changes in climate can affect food production, leading to shortages and higher prices. Additionally, global warming increases the spread of diseases carried by insects, like malaria. To protect ourselves, it is important to reduce pollution, plant more trees, and use cleaner energy sources."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What chemicals are safe for cleaning cattle?","Final Answer":"To keep cattle clean and healthy, farmers use safe and standard veterinary-approved chemicals. For cleaning the animal's skin, the most recommended antiseptic is Povidone-Iodine solution, which helps kill germs and prevent infections without harming the skin. While some people use household antiseptics like Dettol, these are not ideal for animals and may irritate if not properly diluted. For protecting the feet of cattle, especially in wet or muddy conditions, a copper sulfate footbath is commonly used. The correct concentration is a 5\u201310% solution (i.e., 5\u201310 grams of copper sulfate per 100 ml of water), which helps prevent hoof infections and foot rot. To keep the cattle shed clean, lime powder (calcium oxide) is sprinkled on the floor to control moisture and stop insect and parasite growth. Some farmers also use neem-based herbal washes, which are safe, natural, and help keep the cattle's skin healthy. It is important to use all cleaning products in the correct amount and under guidance to avoid harming the animals. Regular cleaning, along with proper hygiene, helps cattle stay strong, disease-free, and productive."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why is there blood in my calf\u2019s dung?","Final Answer":"Bleeding through the excreta (poop) of a calf is a serious sign that the calf may be sick. It can happen because of infections, parasites, or injuries in the intestines.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding govt subsidies for fertiliser","Final Answer":"In India, the main fertilizer subsidy schemes are the Nutrient-Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme and the Urea Subsidy Scheme, and because of these schemes, farmers get fertilizers at much cheaper rates than the actual cost. Under NBS, which started on April 1, 2010, the government fixes a subsidy amount based on the nutrient content, like phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, and even some micronutrients, and gives this subsidy directly to the fertilizer companies so that farmers can buy DAP, MOP, and complex fertilizers at an affordable price. The MRP is fixed by companies but monitored by the government, and an extra subsidy is also given on fortified fertilizers like zinc or molybdenum. For example, in 2024\u201325, an additional \u20b93,500 per metric ton subsidy was given on DAP to control the price. But remember, urea is not covered under NBS; it has a separate subsidy system. The urea price is fully controlled by the government and has been fixed at \u20b9242 per 45 kg bag since March 2018, and the government pays the difference in cost to the companies so that farmers always get urea at the same low price anywhere in the country. The subsidy also covers transport costs, so even in remote villages, the rate remains the same. Now, farmers don\u2019t have to apply for subsidies themselves; they go directly to the companies, and we get fertilizer at the dealer shop at subsidized rates. To buy, you only need to go to authorized dealers who use Aadhaar-linked Point of Sale (PoS) machines; in some states, online portals like e-NAM are also there to check stock and dealers. Normally, an Aadhaar card, a land paper (patta), a bank passbook, and a purchase receipt are the documents asked for in DBT-linked subsidy tracking. This system makes sure fertilizers like urea, DAP, MOP, and complexes remain affordable and available on time for Kharif and Rabi sowing. So, because of these subsidy schemes, our input cost comes down, soil nutrition is balanced, crop yield increases, and farmers\u2019 income is protected even when international fertilizer prices go up. For more details and updated information, you can visit the official websites, like https:\/\/www.fert.nic.in\/fertilizer-subsidy or https:\/\/www.pib.gov.in."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Zinc deficiency in the Paddy crop? ","Final Answer":"Zinc deficiency in paddy leads to Khaira disease. Due to this disease, you can see the symptoms within 10-15 days after transplantation. The younger leaves at the base of the plant turn a pale yellowish-green. As the deficiency worsens, small, rusty brown spots appear on the leaves. The plant's growth is severely stunted, and tillering is significantly reduced. The control of Khaira disease is primarily focused on correcting the zinc deficiency in the soil and the plant. The most common and effective method is to apply zinc sulfate heptahydrate (21%) at 8-10 kg per acre during the last puddling or final land preparation before transplanting. This provides a slow, steady supply of zinc to the plants. If symptoms appear, spray the crop with a solution of 2 kg of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (21%) and 1 kg of slaked lime in 200 liters of water per acre. The first spray should be done as soon as you notice the symptoms. If the symptoms persist after 10-15 days, repeat the spray. Two to three sprays at intervals of 10 days may be required for a full recovery."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to prepare field for Aman Paddy?","Final Answer":"Preparing the field properly is crucial for successful aman paddy cultivation. Choose well-drained lowland to medium lowland fields with good water-holding capacity. Clear the field of previous crop residues, weeds, and stubble to reduce the risk of disease and pest carryover. Perform 2-3 plowings with a tractor or oxen-drawn plow to loosen the soil. Tillage should be deep enough (about 15-20 cm) to break the hardpan and improve aeration and root penetration. Level the field properly to ensure uniform water coverage and prevent waterlogging. After initial plowing, perform puddling to make a soft muddy layer, which helps in transplanting and reduces water loss. Puddling also controls weeds and facilitates better root-soil contact. Use a wooden plank or laser leveling equipment to make the field surface level. Proper leveling ensures uniform water distribution and reduces water wastage. Maintain a shallow water layer (3-5 cm) in the field before and after transplanting. Ensure the field is flooded adequately to reduce weed infestation and ease transplanting. Ensure proper drainage channels are available to avoid water stagnation that can adversely affect crop growth. At the time of final puddling, apply well-decomposed FYM or compost at the rate of 2\u20133 tons per acre. For chemical fertilizers, it is recommended to test your soil and apply fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. The general recommendation (without soil test) is to apply Urea 70-87 kg per acre, DAP 35-52 kg per acre, and Muriate of Potash (MOP) 13-27 kg per acre. Apply the entire quantity of SSP and MOP along with 50% of the urea during final puddling, and keep the remaining 50% of the urea for topdressing at later stages. The field boundaries, or bunds, should be repaired and strengthened to prevent water from flowing out of the field. Prepare nursery beds separately for raising seedlings before transplanting to the main field. This thorough field preparation ensures a suitable environment for Aman paddy growth, leading to healthier crops and improved yield potential."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Termites in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Termites can be damaging pests of rice, especially in the upland or rainfed conditions with light-textured soils and drought stress. Termites create tunnels through plant stems, eat roots, and cause stunted plant growth. The damaged plants can easily be pulled out from the soil. To control termites, an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended. Locate and manually destroy termite mounds near the rice field by digging and removing the queen termites, do deep ploughing to disturb their natural habitat, always maintain optimal water or flood the field or nests with water to drive termites away, maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds and plant residues, and use only well-rotted compost or farm manure. In termite-endemic areas, treat the seed before sowing with Chlorpyrifos 20% EC @ 3-4 ml per kg of seed or Imidacloprid 600 FS  @ 3 ml per kg of seed. Prepare a solution of Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 3-4 ml per litre of water and dip the seedlings' roots for 8-10 hours before transplanting. You can use Metarhizium anisopliae fungus as a biocontrol agent by applying 2 g of spore powder mixed with sawdust into termite mounds or to the soil around infested plants. If your field has a previous termite infestation history, then drench the soil with Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 500 ml per acre mixed with 25-30 kg well-rotted farmyard manure or sand during the last puddling or just before transplanting.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control yellowing in paddy leaves?","Final Answer":"In paddy, yellowing of leaves is a common part of controlling it. Observe the pattern of yellowing carefully to identify the likely nutrient deficiency. Also, maintain irrigation. If the yellowing begins on the older, lower leaves and progresses upward, it is most likely a nitrogen (N) deficiency. The leaves may appear pale green to yellow overall. For controlling it, you can apply 15 to 20 kilograms of urea per acre as a top dressing. This provides approximately 7 to 9 kilograms of actual nitrogen per acre. Ensure the field has a thin layer of water during application for optimal uptake. If the yellowing appears between the veins of the youngest leaves, while the veins themselves remain green, this is interveinal chlorosis and suggests an iron (Fe) deficiency. For controlling it, you can apply a foliar spray of 1.0% ferrous sulfate solution. Dissolve 10 grams of ferrous sulfate in 1 liter of water. Spray this solution over one acre using a total spray volume of 200 liters of water. Two sprays at an interval of 10-15 days may be necessary. If the leaves are stunted and have a yellowish-orange or bronze discolouration, especially in the middle leaves, it could be a zinc (Zn) deficiency, and to control it, you can do soil application; for it, use 10 kilograms of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (21% Zn) per acre during the final land preparation. For a quick corrective measure, use a foliar spray. Dissolve 5 grams of zinc sulfate and 2.5 grams of unslaked lime (to prevent leaf burn) in 1 liter of water. Spray this solution over one acre using a total spray volume of 200 liters of water. For a definitive diagnosis, a soil test conducted through your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or government agriculture office is highly recommended.\nIf the yellowing is accompanied by distinct spots or lesions, it may be a disease like Brown Spot. In such cases, a fungicide application may be needed. A recommended fungicide is Hexaconazole 5% EC. The dose is 2 milliliters per liter of water. For one acre, use 300-400 ml in 200 liters of water. The recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) is 30 days. Always practice good water management. Avoid continuous waterlogging, which can induce nutrient deficiencies, and also avoid drought stress. Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 4-5 tonnes per acre during land preparation to improve overall soil health and nutrient availability. Always wear protective gloves and a mask and cover your skin during mixing and spraying."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about the Cultural Practices of Paddy","Final Answer":"Paddy is cultivated in three distinct seasons: Aus (Pre-Kharif): Sown from March to May and harvested from June to August. It is mostly direct-seeded and rainfed. Aman (Kharif): This is the main paddy season. Nurseries are sown in June\u2013July, transplanting occurs in July\u2013August, and harvesting is from November to January. It is primarily rainfed. Boro (Summer): Sown in nurseries from November to January, transplanted from January to February, and harvested from April to June. This crop is entirely dependent on irrigation. Proper land preparation is crucial for good crop establishment. After 2\u20133 ploughings in summer, the field is flooded with 5\u201310 cm of water and ploughed again. This process, known as puddling, creates an impervious layer, reduces water loss, and controls weeds. After puddling, the land is levelled using a wooden plank (laddering) to ensure uniform water distribution and plant growth. Use certified, healthy seeds (locally recommended varieties from BCKV \/ UBKV \/ NRRI for your agro-ecology), such as IET-4094 (Satabdi), IET-4786 (Aditya), Annada, Swarna (MTU-7029), IET-5656, GB-1, Ranjit, and Swarna Sub-1. For transplanting, a seed rate of 15\u201320 kg per acre is sufficient. To protect against seed-borne diseases, treat seeds with Carboxin + Thiram @ 2 g per kg of seeds. For one acre of the main field, a nursery area of about 1\/10th of an acre is required. Seedlings are ready for transplanting in about 25\u201330 days. Transplant 2\u20133 seedlings per hill. A spacing of 20 cm \u00d7 15 cm is recommended for Aman and Boro paddy. A balanced application of fertilisers is key to high yields. The general recommendation per acre is: Nitrogen (N): 24\u201332 kg (applied in 2\u20133 split doses) Phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085): 12\u201316 kg (applied as a basal dose) Potassium (K\u2082O): 12\u201316 kg (applied as a basal dose) Apply all the phosphorus and potassium, along with the first split of nitrogen, during the final puddling (basal application). The remaining nitrogen is applied in two top dressings at the tillering and panicle initiation stages. Water is the most critical input for paddy. Maintain a shallow water level of 2\u20135 cm throughout the vegetative growth period. Drain the field about 10\u201315 days before harvesting to allow uniform grain maturity and to facilitate harvesting. Tillering, panicle initiation, and flowering are the most sensitive stages, and water stress must be avoided during these periods. Weeds compete with the crop for nutrients, water, and light. One or two manual weedings are effective. For chemical control, apply a pre-emergence herbicide like Pretilachlor 50% EC @ 400 ml\/acre within 2\u20133 days of transplanting. For post-emergence control, Bispyribac Sodium 10% SC @ 80\u2013100 ml\/acre can be used 15\u201325 days after transplanting. The major insect pests of rice are the Yellow Stem Borer, Brown Plant Hopper, and Gundhi Bug. The most significant diseases are Blast, Bacterial Leaf Blight, and Sheath Blight. To control these pests and diseases, the following chemicals are recommended: Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml (PHI 47 Days) Cartap Hydrochloride 50% SP @ 400 g (PHI 21 Days) Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 40 g (PHI 21 Days) Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 40\u201350 ml (PHI 40 Days) Isoprothiolane 40% EC @ 300 ml (PHI 45 Days) Tebuconazole 25.9% EC @ 300 ml (PHI 21 Days) Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml (PHI 30 Days) Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml (PHI 35 Days) Copper Oxychloride 50% WP @ 400 g\/acre (PHI 21 Days). The crop is ready for harvest when the grains in the panicle are golden-yellow and hard (80\u201385% of grains have matured). Harvesting can be done manually with sickles or mechanically with combine harvesters. After harvesting, the crop should be threshed, cleaned, and dried until the moisture content is around 14% for safe storage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about field preparation for Paddy","Final Answer":"Field preparation for paddy involves creating a soft, muddy, and perfectly levelled seedbed, a process known as puddling. This is done to reduce water loss, control weeds, and facilitate the easy transplanting of seedlings. Summer Ploughing (Dry Preparation): This is the initial step, carried out during April\u2013May after the harvest of the Rabi crop. One deep ploughing is done using a mouldboard plough, followed by one or two harrowings to break the clods. Wet Preparation (Puddling): This is the most critical phase for creating the ideal environment for rice seedlings. The soil is churned with standing water to create a soft, muddy top layer (10\u201315 cm deep) and a hard, impervious pan beneath it. The field is flooded with 5\u201310 cm of water a few days before starting. The first ploughing is done in the standing water, followed by 2\u20133 cross-ploughings using a puddler or cultivator until the soil is thoroughly churned into a thick, soft mud. Levelling: This is the final and crucial step after puddling. It ensures that the puddled field is perfectly flat with a uniform depth of water. A wooden plank or a dedicated leveller is dragged across the field, a process locally known as \"laddering.\" This smooths the surface and settles the mud. A shallow water level of about 2\u20133 cm is maintained during levelling. Apply well-decomposed FYM @ 0.8 t\/acre before the first puddling. For basal fertilisers at the time of the last puddling, use either 35 kg DAP + 27 kg MOP per acre or 18 kg urea + 100 kg SSP + 27 kg MOP per acre as a basal combination. These doses may vary according to the variety and soil test."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Is top dressing possible without irrigation?","Final Answer":"No, top dressing without moisture is not effective and is not recommended. For the fertiliser to be absorbed by the plant, it must dissolve in water. Applying it to dry soil can waste the fertilizer and potentially harm the crop. Water is essential for top dressing because when you apply a granular fertilizer like urea, it is in a solid, salt form. Plant roots cannot absorb solid nutrients. Water in the soil acts as a solvent, dissolving the fertilizer granules into a nutrient solution. Plant roots absorb these dissolved nutrients along with water. Once inside the plant, water acts as a transport system, moving the nutrients to the leaves and stems where they are needed for growth. There are several risks associated with top dressing on dry soil: A significant portion of the nitrogen from urea can be lost to the atmosphere as ammonia gas, a process called volatilization, if it sits on a dry surface. If there is only a little moisture (like dew), a very concentrated solution can form. This can draw water out of the plant's roots or leaves, causing them to dry out and \"burn.\" The fertilizer simply sits on the surface, providing no benefit to the crop, making it a waste of money and effort."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the Zinc sulphate application dose?","Final Answer":"Zinc is a crucial micronutrient, and its deficiency is common in the soil, especially in paddy fields. Applying it correctly is essential to prevent yield loss. Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21% Zn): 10 kg per acre. Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate (33% Zn): 8 kg per acre. Apply zinc once every two to three years during the final land preparation, just before transplanting or sowing. Mix the required amount of zinc sulphate with dry soil or sand and broadcast it evenly across the field. To correct zinc deficiency when symptoms appear in the standing crop, apply a foliar spray of 2 grams of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) plus 1 gram of slaked lime (or urea) in one litre of water. Spray this solution over the crop, typically requiring about 200 litres of water per acre. The first spray should be done as soon as symptoms are noticed, followed by a second spray after 10\u201315 days if needed. Adding lime or urea prevents leaf scorching."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about Nursery bed prepration","Final Answer":"Nursery bed preparation involves creating a fertile, well-levelled, and protected area to raise healthy and vigorous paddy seedlings for transplanting. Choose a fertile, well-drained area near a reliable water source. The site should receive ample sunlight and be free from the shade of trees. A nursery area of 1\/10th of the main field area is required. For transplanting one acre of the main field, a nursery of 10 cents (400 sq. meters) is sufficient. While several methods exist, two are predominant in your location, depending on the season and water availability: Wet Bed Nursery (Most Common): This method is used for the main Aman (Kharif) and Boro (Summer) crops, where water is available. The goal is to create a puddled, muddy field for sowing pre-germinated seeds. To make this bed, the selected land is ploughed 2\u20133 times and flooded with water. The soil is then churned or \"puddled\" until it becomes a soft, thick mud. Raised beds are formed, typically 1.0\u20131.5 meters wide and 5\u201310 cm high, with 30 cm channels in between. The surface of the beds is smoothed and perfectly levelled. Pre-germinated seeds are broadcast evenly on the beds. Dry Bed Nursery: This method is used for the Aus (Pre-Kharif) season or in areas with limited water. To make this bed, the land is ploughed to a fine tilth in dry conditions. Raised beds are made with dimensions similar to the wet bed. Dry, treated seeds are sown in lines and covered with a thin layer of soil. The beds are watered lightly using a sprinkler can until the seedlings are established. A basal dose of nutrients is essential for healthy seedling growth. Apply 40\u201350 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per 10 cents of the nursery area. Incorporate a small dose of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085), and Potassium (K\u2082O) during the final bed preparation. The exact dose should be as per the soil test report. 12\u201315 kg of seed is needed for a nursery that will cover one acre of the main field. Transplant seedlings at 20\u201330 days of age for conventional transplanting. For SRI (System of Rice Intensification) methods, use younger seedlings (8\u201315 days)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the Yellowing of leaves in Paddy?","Final Answer":"In paddy, yellowing of leaves is a common symptom of nutrient deficiency. Observe the pattern of yellowing to identify the likely nutrient deficiency, and maintain proper irrigation. Nitrogen (N) deficiency: If yellowing begins on the older, lower leaves and progresses upward, it is most likely due to nitrogen deficiency. The leaves may appear pale green to yellow overall. To correct this, apply 15\u201320 kilograms of urea per acre as a top dressing, which provides approximately 7\u20139 kilograms of actual nitrogen per acre. Ensure the field has a thin layer of water during application for optimal uptake. Iron (Fe) deficiency: If yellowing appears between the veins of the youngest leaves, while the veins themselves remain green (interveinal chlorosis), it indicates an iron deficiency. Correct it by applying a foliar spray of 1% ferrous sulfate solution. Dissolve 10 grams of ferrous sulfate in 1 litre of water and spray over one acre using about 200 litres of water. Two sprays at an interval of 10\u201315 days may be necessary. Zinc (Zn) deficiency: If the leaves are stunted and have a yellowish-orange or bronze discolouration, especially in the middle leaves, it may indicate zinc deficiency. Correct it by applying 10 kilograms of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (21% Zn) per acre during the final land preparation. For a quick corrective measure, use a foliar spray: dissolve 2 kilograms of zinc sulfate and 1 kilogram of unslaked lime (to prevent leaf burn) in water, and spray over one acre using about 200 litres of water. For a definitive diagnosis, a soil test conducted through your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or government agriculture office is highly recommended. If yellowing is accompanied by distinct spots or lesions, it may indicate a disease like Brown Spot. In such cases, apply a fungicide such as Hexaconazole 5% EC. The recommended dose is 2 millilitres per litre of water. For one acre, use 300\u2013400 ml in 200 litres of water. The recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) is 30 days. Always practice good water management. Avoid continuous waterlogging, which can induce nutrient deficiencies, and also avoid drought stress. Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 4\u20135 tonnes per acre during land preparation to improve overall soil health and nutrient availability. Always wear protective gloves, a mask, and cover your skin during mixing and spraying."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage Zinc deficiency in the paddy seedbed?","Final Answer":"Managing zinc deficiency in the paddy seedbed is crucial for raising healthy seedlings, which form the foundation of a good harvest. The first step is to prepare the seedbed on a raised, well-levelled plot to prevent water stagnation, which can induce zinc deficiency. Before sowing, the soil of the nursery bed should be thoroughly incorporated with zinc sulfate. The recommended dose for the seedbed area is 2 to 3 kilograms of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (21% Zn) per acre of nursery bed. This application ensures that the young roots of the seedlings have immediate access to the essential nutrients. An alternative method is to treat the seeds before sowing by soaking them in a 2 to 4% zinc sulfate solution for 24 hours. After soaking, the seeds should be drained and then sown immediately in the prepared nursery bed. If deficiency symptoms like rusty brown spots on leaves or stunted growth appear in the seedlings, a foliar spray can be used as a corrective measure. A solution can be prepared by dissolving 200 to 300 grams of zinc sulfate and 100 grams of urea in 50 liters of water and spraying it evenly over the seedbed. Maintaining proper moisture without waterlogging is key, as excessive water reduces zinc availability to the plants. Using well-decomposed farmyard manure in the seedbed also helps improve the soil's zinc retention capacity. These practices ensure the production of vigorous, zinc-sufficient seedlings that will establish themselves better after transplanting into the main field."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control seedling blight of Boro Paddy seedbed?","Final Answer":"Controlling seedling blight in Boro paddy seedbeds requires an integrated approach. The foundation of control is proper seedbed management, which includes selecting a well-drained site and creating raised beds to avoid waterlogging. The first critical step is seed treatment using recommended fungicides or bio-agents. For chemical treatment, a safe and effective option is Thiram, used at a dose of 2 grams per kilogram of seed. The main recommended biological alternative is the fungus Trichoderma viride, which is a natural antagonist to blight-causing pathogens. The dose for Trichoderma viride is 5 to 10 grams per kilogram of seed. If blight symptoms appear in the nursery, a soil drench can be applied. A solution of 400-500 grams of Carbendazim 50% WP dissolved in 500 liters of water should be applied per acre of nursery area. For a liquid formulation, 400-500 ml of Carbendazim 50% SC in 500 liters of water per acre is effective. Copper-based fungicides, which are generally considered safer and are not banned, are another option. A soil drench with copper oxychloride can be prepared using 1.5 to 2 kilograms of the powder in 500 liters of water per acre. For biological soil treatment, apply Trichoderma-enriched farmyard manure by mixing 2.5 kilograms of Trichoderma formulation with 50 kilograms of FYM and broadcasting it per acre of nursery bed before sowing. It is crucial to avoid banned chemicals and ensure proper application timing and dosage as per label instructions and always take agri-expert advice."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage micronutrient deficiency in Rice?","Final Answer":"Managing micronutrient deficiencies in paddy is crucial for achieving optimal yield and plant health. The most common deficiencies observed are zinc, iron, and sometimes boron. The management strategy begins with a soil test to accurately identify the specific nutrient lacking. For zinc deficiency, which is very prevalent, apply 08 to 10 kilograms of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (21% Zn) per acre as a basal dose during the final land preparation. For foliar correction, a solution of 2 to 2.5 kilograms of zinc sulfate and 1.25 kilograms of urea dissolved in 250 litres of water per acre should be sprayed at tillering and again 15 days later. For iron deficiency, characterized by yellowing of young leaves, a foliar spray of 1% ferrous sulfate solution is recommended. This is prepared by dissolving 5 kilograms of ferrous sulfate in 500 litres of water per acre. Two sprays at an interval of 10-15 days are usually necessary. If boron deficiency is identified, a soil application of 2 to 4 kilograms of borax per acre is advised. A foliar spray can also be used, prepared by dissolving 100 to 200 gm of borax in 100 liters of water per acre. For liquid formulations, the application rate is typically 500 ml to 600 ml\/acre, mixed in 200-250 liters of water as per the manufacturer's instructions on the product label. Integrating these chemical applications with 4 to 5 tons of well-decomposed farmyard manure per acre greatly improves overall soil health and micronutrient availability."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding which fertilizers to use, along with their quantity","Final Answer":"In paddy, fertilizer management is the most crucial thing, applying the right nutrients at the perfect time, which ensures healthy crop growth and higher yield. For paddy cultivation in rainfed areas, give 32-40 kg nitrogen (70-87 kg urea), 16-24 kg phosphorus (35-52 kg DAP), and 8-16 kg potash (13-27 kg MOP) per acre. For paddy cultivation in lowland areas, give 40-48 kg nitrogen (87-104 kg urea), 16-24 kg phosphorus (35-52 kg DAP), and 12-16 kg potash (20-27 kg MOP) per acre. Apply nitrogen (urea) in three equal splits: at sowing, at active tillering, and at the panicle initiation stage. Use zinc sulfate at 8 kg\/acre as a basal dose along with NPK fertilizers for better crop growth. Prolonged rice cultivation depletes organic matter and nutrients in the soil. Incorporate green manures (e.g., sunhemp, dhaincha, or leguminous crops) to improve soil health. Practice crop rotation with pulses to enhance soil fertility. Residue recycling and application of organic manure. Apply well-decomposed FYM (farmyard manure) at 2-4 tonnes per acre. This balanced dose of urea, DAP, and MOP will keep the crop healthy, ensure good tillering, and increase grain yield. Also, you can use micronutrients as per their necessity."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Which are the recommended varieties of paddy?","Final Answer":"For paddy, while choosing varieties, always ensure variety on the basis of early maturity varieties suitable for areas where an early harvest is needed; a common choice is IET 4094, also known as Khitish. The ideal transplanting time for this variety is from mid-May to mid-June. It matures in approximately 110 to 115 days after transplanting. The expected yield ranges from 16 to 20 quintals per acre. This variety is resistant to bacterial leaf blight and exhibits good grain quality. Another early group variety is Swarna (MTU 7029), which is widely cultivated. It is transplanted from mid-June to early July. The maturation period is about 140 to 145 days. The average yield is 20 to 22 quintals per acre. Swarna is known for its adaptability and moderate resistance to several common pests and diseases. For medium to late duration, a recommended disease-resistant variety is Ranjit. Its transplanting window is from June to July. It requires around 135 to 140 days to mature. The yield potential is 20 to 22 quintals per acre.

Transplanting is done from mid-June to July. It matures in 125 to 130 days. The yield is typically 16 to 18 quintals per acre under saline conditions. For areas prone to flooding, Swarna Sub-1 is highly recommended due to its submergence tolerance gene. It is transplanted in June-July, matures in 140-145 days, and yields 20-24 quintals per acre, with the ability to survive waterlogging for up to two weeks."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Leaf browning in Rice?","Final Answer":"Leaf browning in rice can be a symptom of several issues, including nutrient deficiencies, fungal diseases, or physiological disorders, and a correct diagnosis is essential for effective management. A common cause of leaf browning, especially starting from the leaf tip and moving down the margins, is potassium deficiency. To address this, a soil application of 40 to 50 kilograms of muriate of potash per acre is recommended, preferably as a top dressing during the tillering stage. For a quick corrective measure, a foliar spray of 1% potassium nitrate solution can be used, prepared by dissolving 4-5 kilograms of potassium nitrate in 500 litres of water per acre. If the browning is associated with spots and lesions, it may indicate a fungal disease like brown spot or blast. For managing brown spot, a foliar spray of hexaconazole 5% EC can be applied at a dose of 400-500 ml\/acre, mixed in 250 to 300 litres of water. If the cause is identified as bacterial leaf blight, which causes yellow-brown streaks, a copper-based bactericide like copper oxychloride can be used. The recommended dose is 500-600 gm of Copper Oxychloride 50% WP per acre, dissolved in 500 litres of water. It is crucial to ensure proper water management, avoiding both drought stress and continuous flooding, as these conditions can exacerbate nutrient uptake problems and disease development. Soil testing is highly advised to confirm nutrient deficiencies and guide precise fertilizer application."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control algae in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Algal blooms in rice paddies, caused mainly by green algae and cyanobacteria, develop rapidly in nutrient-rich, stagnant water\u2014often due to pre-plant fertilizer application and poor drainage. During the vulnerable transplanting stage, these algae compete fiercely with rice seedlings for nutrients, space, light, and carbon dioxide, leading to inhibited seedling growth, uprooting, oxygen depletion, and stunted plants. Algal mats can also raise water pH and release toxins harmful to fish and humans in rice-fish systems. Managing algal blooms involves deep summer ploughing and fallowing to kill algae through heat, crop rotation with upland crops, and adopting dry or aerobic rice cultivation methods to reduce wet conditions favourable for algae. Improved water management practices like alternate wetting and drying, proper drainage, and cono-weeding help control algae growth. Nutrient management through controlled fertilizer use reduces excess nutrients that fuel blooms. Chemical treatments, such as applying copper sulfate (1 kg\/acre for mild infestations, 2 kg\/acre for severe) and commercial copper-based algicides, can also be effective. Preventing algal blooms early is essential to protect seedling establishment and maintain healthy crop yields."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"About seed bed preparation","Final Answer":"Seedlings for rice can be raised through wet or dry nursery methods, with dry nursery. In a level wet nursery, prepare seedbeds 35\u201340 days before transplanting by ploughinglevelling, puddling, and leveling the field. Use 10% of the main field area as a nursery, apply appropriate fertilizers, and select seeds using a salt solution. Germinate seeds after soaking and incubating, then broadcast them on prepared beds.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Stem borer in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Stem borers are destructive pests of rice that damage the crop from seedling to maturity by boring into the stem. They cause deadhearts during the vegetative stage and whiteheads during the reproductive stage, leading to significant yield losses. Culturally, clipping the tips of seedlings before transplanting helps reduce the carryover of eggs from the nursery. Timely harvesting and deep plowing with flooding after harvest may help. Planting resistant or tolerant varieties such as Ratna, Sasyasree, Vikas, and Pant Dhan 6 also helps minimize infestation. Installing natural enemies like Trichogramma wasps, ladybird beetles, and spiders plays an important role in natural suppression. Chemical control should be based on ETL. Recommended options include Cartap Hydrochloride 50% SP at 400 g per acre (PHI: 21 days). Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC can be sprayed at 60 ml per acre (PHI: 47 days), or Flubendiamide 20% WG can be applied at 50 g per acre (PHI: 21 days). These insecticides are highly effective against larvae and safe for natural enemies when used as per label recommendations. Finally, applying nitrogen fertilizer in split doses, avoiding over-fertilization, and maintaining clean fields without stubble or volunteer rice plants further reduce stem borer risk and crop loss."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to do manure management of Paddy field?","Final Answer":"For effective manure management in paddy cultivation, well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) plays a vital role in improving soil fertility and structure. Before preparing the main field, apply about 0.8 tonnes of FYM per acre. This should be incorporated into the soil before the first puddling operation to enhance nutrient availability and improve soil texture. In addition to manure application in the main field, preparing a healthy nursery is essential for good crop establishment. For mechanical transplanting, mat nursery preparation should start 15\u201320 days before transplanting. A mixture of fine soil and organic manure, such as FYM, compost, or vermicompost is prepared in a 4:1 ratio and spread evenly about 2 cm thick on seedling trays or polythene sheets. Pre-germinated seeds are sown uniformly over this mixture and covered lightly with soil. If the nursery is raised in open conditions, a thin layer of straw or banana leaves is used as a cover for 2\u20133 days to maintain moisture. Regular irrigation is needed to keep the soil moist. Proper manure management through FYM application in both nursery preparation and the main field ensures better soil health, promotes vigorous seedling growth, and leads to improved crop yields."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Green Leaf Hopper (GLH) in Aman Paddy?","Final Answer":"Aman Paddy often referred to as Kharif rice. In paddy, green leaf hopper (GLH) damage first appears as yellowing of leaves starting from the tip and progressing downwards. Affected plants often become stunted with reduced tillering, and in severe cases, patches of hopper burn develop where the leaves dry up completely. Since GLH is also a vector of tungro virus, infected plants may show yellow to orange discoloration, further weakening the crop and reducing yield. To control the pest, apply nitrogen fertilizer in the right amount, not in excess, so that the paddy plants can recover well. After harvesting rice, grow a different crop (not rice) in the dry season to break the life cycle of the green leaf hopper and reduce its population for the next season. If the pest infestation is severe or the pest crosses the ETL (Economic Threshold Level) which is 2 hoppers per hill, then do the chemical control. For chemical control, spray insecticides like Bifenthrin 10% EC at 200 ml\/acre, Buprofezin 25% SC at 320 ml\/acre, Ethofenoprox 10% EC 200-300 ml\/acre or Fipronil 5% SC at 400-600 ml\/acre in 200-250 litres of water.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding general cultivation","Final Answer":"For cultivating paddy first prepare the land. For land preparation do one deep summer ploughing to reduce weeds, insects and diseases. After that, first use a mould board plough, then a disc harrow and finally a rotavator to make the soil soft and fine. Mix well-decomposed FYM (farmyard manure) at 2\u20134 tonnes per acre in the soil about 3 weeks before sowing or transplanting. Plough the land 2\u20133 times at a gap of 4\u20135 days to get the best soil condition. For transplanting, puddle the field two times, keeping a 7\u20138 day gap between the first and second puddling. Use good quality pure seed from reliable sources, treat the seeds before sowing using Pseudomonas fluorescens at 10 g\/kg seed or fungicide like Thiram 75 WP at 3 g\/kg seed to prevent seed-borne diseases. Choose a variety suited to the ecology (irrigated, rainfed, drought-prone, flood\/submergence prone) keeping in mind its duration. For transplanting, use seedlings of about 3-5 leaf stage (21-30 days old), at a spacing of 20 \u00d7 10-15 cm (row \u00d7 plant) with 1-2 seedlings per hill. If using SRI (System of Rice Intensification), plant much younger seedlings (10-12 days old), one seedling per hill, with wider spacing (25 \u00d7 25 cm) to help tillering and reduce competition. For nutrient management, give 32\u201340 kg nitrogen (70\u201387 kg urea), 16\u201324 kg phosphorus (35\u201352 kg DAP) and 8\u201316 kg potash (13\u201327 kg MOP) per acre in rainfed areas. For paddy cultivation in lowland areas, give 40\u201348 kg nitrogen (87\u2013104 kg urea), 16\u201324 kg phosphorus (35\u201352 kg DAP) and 12\u201316 kg potash (20\u201327 kg MOP) per acre. Apply nitrogen (urea) in three equal splits: at sowing, active tillering and at panicle initiation stage. Use zinc sulphate at 8 kg\/acre as a basal dose along with NPK fertilizers for better crop growth. Apply well decomposed FYM (farmyard manure) at 2-4 tonnes per acre. For water management, maintain about 3-5 cm water depth after transplanting, avoid drought especially during tillering, panicle initiation, flowering and grain fill stages. Provide life-saving irrigation during dry spells. Also ensure proper drainage to remove excess water in heavy rains. For fields under direct wet seeding, flood only after seedlings have developed 3-4 leaves. Use alternate wetting and drying (AWD) in dry direct seeded systems to save water. For weed control, ensure timely sowing or transplanting to reduce weed escape. Use land leveling to reduce weed growth. Use mechanical or hand weeding at appropriate times (e.g. around 35 & 55 days after transplanting) along with use of appropriate herbicides (pre-emergence, post-emergence) following local recommendations. Finally, harvesting should be done when grains are fully mature (usually 30-35 days after flowering) and have turned golden yellow. Harvest when grain moisture is about 20-24 %, thresh soon after harvest, then dry the grains to about 11-12 % moisture before storage to prevent spoilage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Brown Leaf Hopper or Brown Plant Hopper attack in Paddy?","Final Answer":"In paddy, Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) attack shows yellowing and drying of leaves starting from the base, leading to \u201chopper burn\u201d patches in the field. Plants may suddenly wilt and lodge in severe cases due to heavy sap sucking at the base of tillers. Brown plant hoppers in paddy increase when too much nitrogen fertilizer is used, plants are grown too close together or the air is very humid. To prevent outbreaks, apply nitrogen in smaller split doses instead of all at once. If there is a heavy infestation, draining the field for 3\u20134 days can help reduce the number of pests. Growing only two rice crops a year and choosing early-maturing varieties also keeps planthopper populations low. If the pest infestation is severe or the pest crosses the ETL (Economic Threshold Level) which is 10-15 hoppers per hill, then do the chemical control. For chemical control, spray insecticides like Buprofezin 25% SC at 320 ml\/acre, Ethofenoprox 10% EC 200-300 ml\/acre, Fipronil 5% SC at 400-600 ml\/acre or Flonicamid 50% WG at 60 g\/acre in 200-250 litres of water.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control algae in Paddy (Rice) field?","Final Answer":"Algae consumes oxygen from water of the paddy field and produces carbon dioxide, which results in yellowing and dwarfing of paddy plants. For the control of algae, follow Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) to manage water levels. Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) in paddy is a water-saving technique where fields are not kept continuously flooded. Instead, the field is allowed to dry until the water level drops about 5 cm below the soil surface, then it is irrigated again to maintain 3\u20135 cm of standing water. Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) controls algae in paddy by periodically draining the field, which exposes algae to air and sunlight, reducing their growth. This also prevents stagnant water that favors algae proliferation. You can also do soil drenching using 1% Bordeaux mixture (1 kg copper sulphate + 1 kg fresh hydrated lime + 100 litres of water). Among all measures, alternate wetting and drying is the best management practice."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to prepare the field for Boro Paddy?","Final Answer":"Boro is a winter season, photo-insensitive, transplanted rice cultivated on supplemental irrigation. This gives the farmers a chance to grow a rabi season crop which normally they could not grow. Boro paddy is cultivated during the Rabi season (November to May), relying heavily on irrigation. Land preparation is a very important step for getting good yield in rice. Proper preparation makes the soil physically soft, improves fertility and creates good conditions for crop growth. In deep water areas, when the water level starts going down from the sides, puddling and transplanting should start from the outer edge and slowly move towards the centre. In other areas, first plough the land 3\u20134 times and do laddering with water. After about one week, again plough the field 2\u20133 times in the presence of water and do laddering to make a good puddle. During laddering, level the field properly so that irrigation water spreads evenly everywhere. The depth of ploughing should be around 10\u201315 cm. Before doing the final puddling, apply the basal dose of fertilizer so that the rice crop gets enough nutrients right from the beginning."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Brown Plant Hopper in Boro Paddy?","Final Answer":"In paddy, Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) attack shows yellowing and drying of leaves starting from the base, leading to \u201chopper burn\u201d patches in the field. Plants may suddenly wilt and lodge in severe cases due to heavy sap sucking at the base of tillers. Brown plant hoppers in paddy increase when too much nitrogen fertilizer is used, plants are grown too close together or the air is very humid. To prevent outbreaks, apply nitrogen in smaller split doses instead of all at once. If there is a heavy infestation, draining the field for 3\u20134 days can help reduce the number of pests. Growing only two rice crops a year and choosing early-maturing varieties also keeps planthopper populations low. If the pest infestation is severe or the pest crosses the ETL (Economic Threshold Level) which is 10-15 hoppers per hill, then do the chemical control. For chemical control, spray insecticides like Buprofezin 25% SC at 320 ml\/acre, Ethofenoprox 10% EC 200-300 ml\/acre, Fipronil 5% SC at 400-600 ml\/acre or Flonicamid 50% WG at 60 g\/acre in 200-250 litres of water.  Always follow the PHI (Pre-Harvest Interval) of 20 days for Buprofezin 25% SC, 15 days for Ethofenoprox 10% EC, 32 days for Fipronil 5% SC and 36 days for Flonicamid 50% WG."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Brown Plant Hopper (Red)?","Final Answer":"White ear in rice happens when the panicle\u2014the flowering head\u2014turns white and the grains remain unfilled. This usually occurs because of stem borer attacks, mainly from pests like the yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) and the white rice borer (Scirpophaga excerptalis). These insects lay eggs on the plant, and their larvae bore into the central shoot, causing dead heart at the tillering stage and white ear at the flowering stage, leading to poor grain formation. Farmers can manage this by planting resistant varieties like CR Dhan 801 and CR Dhan 802, BRRI Dhan-69, CR Dhan-511, DRH-775, Manisha, Swarna Unnat Dhan, and Vijaya, which tolerate stem borer attacks. Timely planting helps avoid heavy pest infestations, while field sanitation, such as removing and destroying affected plants, reduces pest populations. If damage is noticed, you may apply recommended insecticides following local guidance. Avoid excess nitrogen, as lush, soft growth attracts more borers. Maintain proper field bunding and regulate irrigation to avoid creating conditions favorable for pest growth.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about fertilizer dose for Paddy","Final Answer":"Fertilizer management in paddy is very important to provide the right nutrients at the right time, which helps the crop grow well and gives a higher yield. For rainfed paddy fields, farmers should apply 32\u201340 kg nitrogen (70\u201387 kg urea), 16\u201324 kg phosphorus (35\u201352 kg DAP), and 8\u201316 kg potash (13\u201327 kg MOP) per acre. In lowland paddy fields, apply 40\u201348 kg nitrogen (87\u2013104 kg urea), 16\u201324 kg phosphorus (35\u201352 kg DAP), and 12\u201316 kg potash (20\u201327 kg MOP) per acre. Nitrogen (urea) should be applied in three equal splits: at sowing, during active tillering, and at the panicle initiation stage. Use zinc sulfate at 8\u201310 kg per acre as a basal dose along with NPK fertilizers to improve crop growth. Apply zinc sulfate based on the soil test only. Continuous rice cultivation reduces soil organic matter and nutrients, so incorporate green manures like sunhemp, dhaincha, or other leguminous crops to maintain soil fertility. Practice crop rotation with pulses to enrich the soil, recycle crop residues, and apply well-decomposed FYM at 2\u20134 tonnes per acre.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me information regarding paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"Paddy cultivation during the Rabi season (also called Boro rice) is an important agricultural practice relying mainly on irrigation. The Rabi (Boro) season is when the secondary rice crop is sown in November\u2013December and harvested in April\u2013May. Boro rice depends on irrigation, allowing stable yields even in less favourable rainfall years. The recommended varieties for the Boro season are IET-4786 (Satabdi), Lalat, WGL-20471 (Lal minikit), IR-36, CR-126-42-1, IET-1444, IET-2233, IET-4094 (Khitish), CR Dhan 601, BRRI Dhan 69, and PAN 802 (IET-23498). Land is prepared thoroughly with ploughing and levelling to ensure efficient water management and uniform seedling growth. Nursery raising is done in raised beds to prevent water stagnation and seedling diseases. Paddy grows best in alluvial clay loam or silty loam soils, which can hold water yet drain adequately. Seedlings should be raised in nurseries between 1st and 15th December and transplanted to the main field between 15th and 30th January, using 25\u201340-day-old seedlings. The crop matures in approximately 120 to 130 days, with harvesting occurring by March-April. A slightly acidic to neutral pH of 5.5\u20136.5 is preferred. Before sowing, treat rice seeds with either Mancozeb + Carbendazim at 2 g or Trichoderma viride at 10 g dissolved in 10\u201312 ml water per kg seed. Prepare a paste of the solution and rub it thoroughly on the seeds. For transplanting, seedlings should be planted at a spacing of 20\u00d715 cm. Direct seeding is an option in drought-prone areas. Apply 22 kg neem-coated urea + 126.5 kg SSP + 25.5 kg MOP per acre as a basal dose at the time of sowing\/transplanting. For the first top-dressing (maximum tillering stage), apply 44 kg of neem-coated urea per acre. For second top-dressing (panicle initiation stage), apply 22 kg neem-coated urea + 8 kg MOP per acre. During land preparation, apply 2.8\u20133.2 tons\/acre of well-decomposed cow dung\/FYM or 0.6\u20130.8 tons\/acre of vermicompost, or practice green manuring. For better yield, apply 6\u20138 kg of zinc sulfate monohydrate (33%) per acre during puddling. But it is always recommended to do a soil test before fertilizer application for better results and reduced cost. Maintain a water depth of 3\u20135 cm during the crop period. Avoid water stress during tillering and panicle initiation. Fields should be drained 10\u201315 days before harvest to facilitate harvesting. Pre-emergence herbicides, such as Pendimethalin 30% EC, or manual weeding are recommended for weed control. Major pests include brown planthopper, stem borer, and leaf folder, which should be managed using Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices. Diseases such as leaf blast and bacterial leaf blight can be controlled by using resistant varieties and timely fungicide application. Paddy is harvested when grains turn golden yellow and have 20\u201324% moisture content. After threshing, the grains should be dried to 14% moisture for safe storage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How is seed testing of paddy done?","Final Answer":"Seed testing for paddy is a crucial process to ensure the quality of seeds before they are sown. It helps farmers determine the germination percentage, purity, and overall health of the seed lot, which directly impacts crop yield and success. A representative sample is taken from the seed lot to ensure accurate testing results. The sample is analysed to determine the proportion of pure paddy seeds, inert matter (like broken seeds, husk), weed seeds, and seeds of other crops. After separating and weighing each component, their percentages are calculated. For the germination test, take a sample (generally 100 seeds), place it on moist blotting paper, sand or cotton, and incubate it under controlled temperatures and humidity.  Germinated seeds are counted after 7\u201310 days to calculate the germination percentage. The germination percentage is calculated by dividing the number of normal seedlings by the total number of seeds tested and multiplying by 100. For example, if 90 out of 100 seeds germinate, the germination percentage is 90%. A high germination percentage (typically above 80% for certified seeds) indicates a healthy and reliable seed lot. Special tests like the tetrazolium test or accelerated ageing test are sometimes used to assess seed vigour and viability, providing insights into seed health beyond simple germination. A simple and widely used method by farmers is the saltwater test.  Salt is added to water until the density is high enough (often tested with a raw egg that floats to the top). When the seeds are added, the healthy, heavier seeds sink to the bottom, while the light, damaged, or unviable seeds float and can be easily removed. The sunken seeds are then washed to remove the salt before sowing. It is also recommended to always use certified seeds, check germination before nursery sowing, and store seeds in cool, dry and clean conditions to maintain viability. Accurate moisture content is important for storage and vigour. Common methods include the oven-drying method and portable moisture meters."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in Paddy nursery bed?","Final Answer":"Controlling weeds in a paddy nursery bed is a critical step in ensuring healthy, vigorous seedlings for transplanting. If weeds are not managed effectively at this stage, they can compete with the young rice plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight, leading to stunted growth and a poor crop stand in the main field. Always use clean, certified seeds free from weed seeds. A simple method is the saltwater test, where unviable seeds and weed seeds float and can be removed. Prepare a clean nursery bed free from weeds by thorough land preparation and soil mixing before sowing. After sowing sprouted seeds in a puddled nursery, the water should be drained completely for 24\u201348 hours. This allows the delicate roots to anchor into the soil. A very shallow film of water should be applied only after the seedlings are established. Perform manual weeding during early seedling stages to remove emerging weeds. Use the stale seedbed technique: prepare the nursery bed in advance, allow weed seeds to germinate, then destroy them mechanically or chemically before sowing rice seed. For chemical control, apply pre-emergence herbicides correctly and in the right dose for the nursery area. A common and safe option is Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl 10 WP  @ 4-6 grams per 150-160 m\u00b2 nursery bed, applied within 2\u20133 DAS (days after sowing). Always mix herbicides uniformly with sand and manage water carefully to avoid phytotoxicity."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What should be the procedure for seed collection in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Choose well-matured, healthy, and disease-free paddy plants from approved seed production fields for seed collection. Avoid plants affected by pests, diseases, and lodging. Conduct regular field inspections from sowing to harvest to remove off-types and maintain genetic purity by eliminating undesirable plants. Harvest paddy seeds when about 80\u201385% of the grains have turned yellow, indicating physical maturity. Harvest on a dry, sunny day to prevent seed damage and deterioration; avoid harvesting during rain. Threshing should be done soon after harvest to separate grains from straw, while minimising grain damage. Clean seeds thoroughly to remove immature grains, chaff, and other non-seed materials. Dry seeds properly in the shade to reduce moisture content to about 12\u201314% for safe storage. Store seeds"}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Weed control","Final Answer":"Weed management is a crucial thing in paddy crops. Begin with deep plowing immediately after the first rains to expose weed seeds and underground propagules to sunlight, which desiccates and kills them. Allow the field to remain undisturbed for 10 to 15 days after plowing. This encourages the germination of weed seeds. Perform shallow tilling or harrowing operations to destroy these newly germinated weeds. This significantly reduces the initial weed population. Ensure proper leveling of the field after these operations. A well-leveled field ensures uniform water distribution, which is crucial for effective weed control after transplanting. For chemicals, the correct timing is after sowing (or transplanting in wet land), but before weed and crop emergence, usually within 2 to 3 days of transplanting in puddled fields. A recommended herbicide for this stage is Pendimethalin 30% EC. For one acre, using a spray volume of 200 liters of water, the required amount is 1.3 to 2 liters\/acre. An alternative is Oxadiargyl 80% WP, which is also used for pre-emergence control of grasses and broadleaf weeds. The dose for Oxadiargyl 80% WP is 0.25 grams per liter of water. For one acre, using 200 liters of water, the dose is 50 grams per acre. Apply it similarly as a pre-emergence herbicide, but it is recommended after transplanting (1 to 5) or after sowing for direct-seeded rice. In post-emergence you can use bispyribac-sodium 10% SC: This herbicide is effective against grasses, broad-leaved weeds, and sedges. The dose is 0.5 milliliters per liter of water. For one acre, use 100 milliliters in 200 liters of water. The recommended PHI is 90 days. Ethoxysulfuron 15% WDG: This herbicide is mainly effective against broad-leaved weeds and sedges. The dose is 0.2 grams per liter of water. For one acre, use 40 grams in 200 liters of water. The recommended PHI is 110 days. Always use personal protective equipment, including gloves, a mask, and protective clothing, during herbicide handling and application."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about Paddy field preparation after seed germination","Final Answer":"The initial seed germination for paddy typically occurs in a small, well-prepared nursery bed. This stage is crucial for raising healthy seedlings that will later be transplanted into the main field. Once the seeds have successfully germinated and the seedlings begin to grow in the nursery, the focus shifts to preparing the main field. This preparation is vital to create an ideal environment for the young seedlings to establish themselves and thrive. The main field is first ploughed thoroughly to a depth of about 15-20 centimeters. This initial plowing is done when the soil is dry to break up large clods, incorporate crop residues, and uproot weeds. After the dry plowing, the field is flooded with water for a few days. This soaking process softens the soil and makes subsequent operations easier. Following the soaking, the field is puddled. Puddling is a process of repeatedly tilling the saturated soil using a puddler or a tractor-drawn rotavator. This operation churns the soil into a soft mud, which helps to break down soil aggregates, level the field, and create an impermeable layer below the surface. This layer reduces water percolation and helps in conserving water. Weeds and remaining stubble from the previous crop are incorporated into the soil during puddling, where they decompose and add organic matter. After puddling, the field is leveled meticulously using a wooden or iron plank, known as a \"leveler.\" A perfectly level field ensures uniform water depth, which is critical for even crop growth, efficient fertilizer use, and effective weed management. Once the field is puddled and leveled, it is left to settle for a short period, usually one or two days. This allows the soil particles to settle and creates a stable base for transplanting. The best incorporated during the final ploughing or the first puddling, organic manure like well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost is often applied and incorporated into the puddled soil to enrich it with nutrients. The seedlings are considered ready for transplanting from the nursery to the main field when they are about 18-22 days old for short-duration varieties and 25-30 days old for medium- to long-duration varieties, typically reaching a height of 15-20 cm."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended herbicides for the field?","Final Answer":"Weed management is a crucial thing in paddy crops.

Another medium-duration variety is IET 4094, which is promoted for its reliability. It typically matures in 115 to 120 days."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I resolve germination problem?","Final Answer":"Germination problems in paddy can be due to several factors, and resolving them requires a systematic approach. First, accurately diagnose the problem by observing the symptoms and recent field conditions. If seeds are rotting or seedlings are dying before or after emergence with signs of mold, a soil-borne fungal disease is likely. For this, treating seeds with a fungicide before sowing is the most effective preventive measure. A common and effective chemical for this is carbendazim. The recommended application rate for seed treatment is 2 grams of Carbendazim 50% WP per kilogram of paddy seed. If you practice direct seeding and weeds are outcompeting young seedlings, a pre-emergence herbicide may be necessary. Herbicides like Pendimethalin 30% EC can be applied at a rate of 800-1000 ml per acre in 200 liters of water, 1 to 3 days after transplanting. Ensure your soil has good tilth and is properly leveled after puddling to avoid waterlogging, which suffocates seeds. Always do soil testing from your nearby KVK center, and also you can do salt treatment. Always use certified seeds with a high germination rate from a reliable source to avoid inherent viability issues."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What happens when excessive nitrogenous fertilizer is given?","Final Answer":"Applying excessive nitrogenous fertilizer in paddy crops, which leads to several significant problems for the crop, the environment, and the farmer's economics. The most immediate effect is a decline in nitrogen use efficiency, meaning a large portion of the applied fertilizer is not absorbed by the plant. This excess nitrogen is lost to the environment, contributing to air and water pollution through the emission of greenhouse gases and the contamination of water bodies. The crop itself becomes overly succulent and dark green, making it more attractive and susceptible to attacks by pests like brown plant hoppers and diseases like blast and sheath blight. Furthermore, the plant develops weak stems, a condition that often leads to lodging, where the crop falls over before harvest, resulting in severe yield losses. To control the negative effects of excessive nitrogen, the primary strategy is to adopt improved management practices rather than applying corrective chemicals. The most effective approach is to follow a balanced and integrated nutrient management system, combining inorganic fertilizers with organic sources like farmyard manure or compost. A key practice is to split the application of nitrogen into multiple doses, typically three, to match the crop's uptake stages: at final land preparation, at active tillering, and at panicle initiation. For paddy cultivation in the lateritic areas of West Bengal, research suggests an optimal nitrogen dose of approximately 40 to 48 kg nitrogen (87 to 104 kg) per acre. It is always recommended to do soil tests and apply fertilizer based on soil test recommendations. If lodging has already occurred due to over-fertilization, there is no chemical solution to reverse it, and the focus must shift to proper water management and balanced nutrition for future crops. You can use some lodging-resistant varieties like CNRH 102 (IET 22913), CR Dhan 320 (IET 27914), DRRH 2 (IET 18076), and PAN 802 (IET-23498) (Hybrid)."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Leaf feeder in Rice?","Final Answer":"Leaf feeders, such as leaf folders and caseworms, can be managed through an integrated pest management approach, which prioritizes healthy crop practices before chemical intervention. Regular field monitoring is crucial to detect pest presence early, before they reach an economic threshold that justifies insecticide use. Encouraging natural predators like spiders and dragonflies by avoiding prophylactic insecticide sprays helps maintain a balanced ecosystem in your field. If pest levels exceed economic thresholds, selective insecticides that are less harmful to natural enemies should be chosen. For controlling leaf folders, a recommended chemical is Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC. The application dose for this insecticide is 50-60 ml per acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. The pre-harvest interval, which is the waiting period between the last spray and harvest, for chlorantraniliprole is 47 days. Another effective option for leaf feeders is Flubendiamide 20 WG. The application dose for Flubendiamide is 40 - 50 grams per acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. The pre-harvest interval for flubendiamide is 30 days. For a broader spectrum of pests, including leaf feeders, you may consider Thiamethoxam 25 WG. The application dose for Thiamethoxam is 60-80 grams per acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. The pre-harvest interval for thiamethoxam is 21 days. Always ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage during application and strictly adhere to the recommended pre-harvest interval for consumer safety. Always wear safety gear while spraying."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended time for transplanting of Rice?","Final Answer":"\"The recommended transplanting time for paddy in West Bengal is primarily determined by the season and the specific variety being cultivated. The main rice-growing seasons are 'Aman' (the monsoon season) and 'Boro' (the winter season). For the Aman season, which is the principal rice crop, transplanting is typically done from June to July. The ideal window for transplanting Aman rice is the first fortnight of July for most regions of the state. This timing ensures that the critical growth stages of the crop coincide with the reliable monsoon rains. For the Boro season, which is an irrigated crop, transplanting occurs in the winter months. The common practice is to transplant Boro rice from December to January. However, in coastal saline zones, research recommends transplanting between mid-November and mid-December for optimal yield and water use efficiency. Early maturing varieties within these seasons are transplanted at the beginning of these windows to avoid terminal heat stress. Late-maturing varieties are transplanted according to the standard seasonal schedule but require a longer field duration.\""}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Leaf Blast in Rice?","Final Answer":"To control leaf blast in rice, an integrated approach should be used that combines resistant varieties, proper cultural practices, and the timely application of effective fungicides.

A second spray may be needed after 15 days if the disease pressure is high. Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, goggles, and full-sleeved clothing during mixing and spraying. Spray during the cool hours of the day (morning or evening) to ensure better efficacy and reduce evaporation."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Leaf browning in RIce?","Final Answer":"Controlling leaf browning in rice requires first identifying the correct cause, as it's a symptom of several different issues, including nutrient deficiencies, diseases, or soil problems. The control measure depends entirely on the proper diagnosis. The most common causes for browning leaves in West Bengal are Potassium deficiency, Zinc deficiency, and the fungal disease Brown Spot. Potassium (K) Deficiency: This is a common nutrient deficiency that often appears in the later growth stages. Browning starts at the tips and edges of the older, lower leaves, which may also appear yellowish. The plant looks droopy, and the stems are weak. To manage this for a quick correction, apply a 1% Muriate of Potash (MOP) solution as a foliar spray. Dissolve 2 kg of MOP in 200 litres of water and spray evenly over the crop.  Zinc (Zn) Deficiency (Khaira Disease): This is a widespread micronutrient deficiency in the paddy fields. Small, scattered rusty-brown spots appear on the lower leaves. These spots can merge, causing the entire leaf to dry out and die. Plant growth is severely stunted. To manage zinc deficiency, apply a solution of 0.5% Zinc sulfate and 0.25% Slaked Lime. Dissolve 10 kg of Zinc Sulphate and 1 kg of slaked lime in 200 litres of water and spray. The lime is crucial to prevent leaf scorching. Brown Spot Disease: This is a major fungal disease, especially in nutrient-deficient soils. Distinct oval-shaped spots with a dark brown margin and a greyish centre appear on the leaves. The spots are scattered and can cause the entire leaf to turn brown and dry up. To control this disease, give a foliar spray of Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml per acre (PHI 30 Days), Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 11.4% SC @ 200 ml per acre (PHI 21 Days). "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weeds in a Paddy field after 25 days of sowing?","Final Answer":"Weed management at 25 days after sowing is a critical stage, as weeds compete strongly with the crop for nutrients, light, and water. The primary method for controlling weeds at this stage is through the application of post-emergence herbicides and by hand weeding. It is crucial to identify the dominant weed types in your field, such as grasses, broad-leaved weeds, or sedges, to select the most appropriate herbicide. Always ensure proper moisture management in the field before herbicide application. The field should have moist soil but without standing water at the time of spraying.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the sowing process of paddy using a drum seeder?","Final Answer":"The sowing process for paddy using a drum seeder begins with field preparation, which involves thorough puddling and leveling to create a soft, saturated seedbed. Next, seeds are pre-germinated by soaking them in water for about 24 hours, then draining and keeping them in a gunny bag for another 24 hours until small sprouts emerge. The pre-germinated seeds are then loaded into the drums of a manually operated drum seeder. An operator pulls the seeder in straight lines across the prepared field. The seeder deposits the sprouted seeds in neat rows at a consistent spacing, typically 20 centimeters apart. This method sows seeds in a line, similar to transplantation, but without the separate nursery stage. For one acre of land, the entire operation with a standard drum seeder can be completed in approximately one day. After sowing, a thin layer of water is maintained in the field to support the germinating seeds. This technique significantly reduces the required seed quantity compared to traditional broadcast sowing. It also saves a substantial amount of labor and cost by eliminating the need for nursery raising, seedling uprooting, and manual transplanting. The row spacing provided by the drum seeder also makes future weeding and other intercultural operations much easier to perform."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Plant Hopper? ","Final Answer":"For controlling the Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) in paddy fields, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is followed.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage Zinc deficiency in my Paddy?","Final Answer":"Zinc deficiency is a major issue in the paddy fields, leading to a disease called 'Khaira,' which can significantly reduce yield. The application of zinc can be done in two ways:Basal Soil Application (Preventive Method): This is the most effective and recommended method to ensure zinc is available to the crop from the beginning. Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21% Zn) is most commonly used at 10 kg per acre. This should be applied during the final stage of land preparation, just before transplanting. Mix the required amount of zinc sulfate with 20-25 kg of dry soil or sand to ensure it spreads evenly, and then broadcast it across the puddled field. This application is generally recommended once every three years or based on a soil test report. If the deficiency symptoms of \"Khaira\" disease appear in the standing crop, you can give a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulfate and 0.25% slaked lime. To make this for one acre, dissolve 1 kg of zinc sulfate and 0.5 kg of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) in 200 liters of water. Lime is crucial, as it neutralizes the acidic effect of the zinc sulfate, preventing the leaves from getting scorched or burnt. Spray the solution thoroughly over the crop. The first spray should be done as soon as symptoms are noticed. If needed, a second and third spray can be done at intervals of 10-15 days."}

Ploughing fields after harvest, removing volunteer rice plants, and clearing weeds on bunds help eliminate sources of the virus. Light traps with soapy water are useful for monitoring and reducing leafhopper populations, especially in seedbeds. Maintaining proper plant spacing can also limit disease spread. Early detection and removal of infected plants are critical to prevent spread. Monitoring green leafhopper populations, especially between July and October, is essential. For diagnosis, farmers can rely on visual symptoms such as stunted growth, yellow to orange leaves with rust spots, and reduced tillering, or perform an iodine test, where infected leaves show dark blue streaks. Systemic insecticides like Thiamethoxam 25 WG (40 g\/acre) or Deltamethrin 11% EC (60 ml\/acre) are effective for controlling green leafhoppers, the vector of rice tungro disease. These should be applied using 200\u2013240 litres of water per acre, ideally at 15 and 30 days after transplanting, or based on pest monitoring. Use them judiciously and rotate different insecticides to prevent resistance and protect beneficial insects."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about Agriculture Pesticides?","Final Answer":"Pesticides are chemical substances designed to eliminate or control pests, including insects, rodents, fungi, and weeds. Globally, over 1,000 different types of pesticides are in use. In public health, pesticides help control disease vectors like mosquitoes that spread malaria, dengue, and other illnesses. In agriculture, they are essential tools to protect crops from insect damage, fungal infections, and competition from weeds, helping to ensure higher yields and food security. However, responsible use and adherence to safety guidelines are critical to minimize risks to human health, beneficial organisms, and the environment."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Hoppers and Root rot in Rice?","Final Answer":"Planthopper and root rot are two major threats to rice productivity, especially under intensive farming systems. Planthopper outbreaks, mainly caused by Brown Planthopper (BPH) and Whitebacked Planthopper (WBPH), are favouredhelps by excessive nitrogen application, dense planting, high humidity, and shaded conditions. Effective management begins with split nitrogen application instead of a single heavy dose, draining fields for 3\u20134 days during high infestations, and restricting cultivation to two crops per year using early-maturing or resistant varieties (e.g., Vijetha, Chaitanya, Krishnaveni, Pratibha, Vajram, and Makom for BPH and HKR 120 and HKR 126 for WBPH). Synchronized planting within a 3-week window across farms and maintaining rice-free interdiscolouration help break pest cycles. Reducing field shading and removing weeds and alternate grassy hosts limits breeding sites. Encourage natural predators like mirid bugs, spiders, and parasitoid wasps by preserving ecological balance. If the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) of 1 hopper per plant is crossed, apply insecticides such as Imidacloprid 18.5% EC at 40-60 ml\/acre (PHI: 40 days), Ethofenprox 10% EC at 200-300 ml\/acre (PHI: 15 days), or Buprofezin 25% SC at 320 ml\/acre (PHI: 20 days), using 200-250 liters of water per acre. Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance and strictly follow pre-harvest intervals (PHIs). At the same time, root rot in rice, caused by soilborne fungi like Fusarium spp., Pythium dissotocum, and P. spinosum, is a common disease, especially in poorly drained, waterlogged, or nutrient-deficient soils. Symptoms include brown to black discoloration of roots, leaf yellowing, poor tillering, and stunted growth. Management includes improving drainage, balanced application of nitrogen and potassium, and avoiding continuous submergence. For seed-borne infection, treat seed with Carbendazim at 2 g\/kg or use hot water treatment at 53\u201354\u00b0C for 10\u201312 minutes (after pre-soaking in cold water for 8 hours) (used under expert guidance). In infected fields, use soil drenching or root-zone application of systemic fungicides such as Metalaxyl + Mancozeb at 500 g\/acre or Propamocarb hydrochloride at 300 ml\/acre to suppress Pythium spp. Avoid ratooning, remove infected stubble, and practice crop rotation with non-host crops to lower inoculum levels. Though resistant varieties are limited, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods ensures effective management of both planthopper pests and root rot disease, ultimately improving plant health and rice yields."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What causes yellowing of leaves and how can it be corrected?","Final Answer":"Yellowing of paddy leaves, also known as chlorosis, is often due to nutrient deficiencies, particularly nitrogen (N), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sulphur (S) or zinc (Zn). These deficiencies can significantly affect rice growth and yield.\n\nNitrogen (N) :  Pale yellow chlorosis begins at the leaf tip and progresses towards the base, the entire field may appear yellowish.\nCorrection : Apply soil test based 1\/3rd recommended dose of nitrogen as basal. Top dress urea in 2 splits for HYVs (High-Yielding Variety seeds) and 3 splits for hybrids. Adopt integrated nutrient management by using inorganic nitrogen fertilizer, organic manures, bio fertilizers and green manures. Apply 2% urea solution (20 g\/litre of water) as foliar spray for quick recovery of standing crops after submergence and repeat it at 10 -15 days interval. Incorporate legumes into the rotation.\n\nPotassium (K) : Yellowing of leaves progresses from the tip to base and margin to midrib of the leaves.\nCorrection : Apply recommended dose of soil test based potassium as basal. In extremely light textured soils and in hybrids, apply potassium in 2 splits at basal and panicle initiation. Wherever possible recycle the crop residue\/apply organic manures.\n\nIron (Fe) : Appearance of interveinal chlorosis characterized by a fine reticulate network of green veins in younger leaves. If deficiency persists, the whole leaf turns pale yellow.\nCorrection : Reclaim alkaline calcareous soils. Grow iron efficient rice cultivars. Apply organic manure well before sowing. Ponding of water in nursery beds during dry spells. Green manuring with dhaincha before rice transplanting, wherever possible. Copious irrigation of rice fields as soon as chlorosis appears. Spray with un-neutralized 1% FeSO\u2084\u00b77H\u2082O (ferrous sulfate heptahydrate) solution (10 g\/litre of water) 2-3 times at 10 days interval. In soils with very low levels of Fe, broadcast FeSO4 .7H2 O @ 12 kg Fe per acre as basal.\n\nSulphur (S) : The leaf canopy appears pale yellow due to yellowing of the younger leaves. Yellowish seedlings in nursery beds with retarded growth. Leaves show uniform chlorosis of the veins and interveinal tissues and sometimes the leaf tips may become necrotic. In later stages, the pale yellow, youngest leaf turns white. The symptoms are very similar to those of nitrogen deficiency. However, the N deficiency symptom first appears in older leaves.\nCorrection : Apply 4 kg sulphur per acre if moderate sulphur deficiency is observed, in case of severe sulphur deficiency; apply 8-16 kg sulphur per acre. Apply sulphur at least once in three years or after two subsequent rice crops. Use slow acting sulphur forms by mixing gypsum and elemental sulphur in light textured, highly permeable soils well before sowing.\n\nZinc (Zn) : In seedlings, yellowing (chlorosis) starts from the base of older leaves and progresses towards the leaf tip. Reddish brown, irregular blotches appear on the leaf blades (bronzing). Midribs of the younger leaves, especially at the base become chlorotic. In case of severe deficiency, the entire leaf may give a rusty brown appearance which is known as \u201cKhaira\u201d disease.\nCorrection : Apply 10 kg ZnSO4 (Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate - 21%) per acre before transplanting\/sowing and repeat it after three seasons in the fields of known zinc deficiency. The deficiency can be corrected by dipping seedling roots in a 2% ZnO (zinc oxide) suspension (20\u00a0g\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO\u00a0in\u00a01\u00a0liter\u00a0of\u00a0water).

Fields should be ploughed 2\u20133 times for puddled transplanted rice and leveled to maintain uniform water depth. Seeds should be treated with carbendazim, captan, or thiram @ 2-2.5 grams per kg seed. Prepare the seedbed between May 20 to June 5, and transplanted to the main field in between June 10 to June 25.  For transplanting, seedlings aged 25\u201330 days should be planted at a spacing of 20\u00d715 cm. Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Micronutrients such as zinc and boron may be applied depending on soil test results. Maintain a water depth of 3\u20135 cm during the crop period. Avoid water stress during tillering and panicle initiation.  Pre-emergence herbicides, such as Pendimethalin 30% EC, Pretilachlor, or post-emergence herbicide like Bispyribac-Sodium 10% SC should be applied at 15-20 DAT(days after transplanting), or manual weeding are recommended for weed control. Fields should be drained 10\u201315 days before harvest to facilitate harvesting. The crop yield is mainly affected by pests like yellow stem borers, brown plant hopper, leaf folder, and diseases like blast, sheath blight, bacterial leaf blight, and false smut. Root dipping of the seedlings in Pseudomonas luorescens (mixed in water @ 10 grams per litre of water) for 30 min before transplantation, will give protection against stem rot. For controlling stem borers, spray chemical insecticides such as Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water, or Flubendiamide 39.35 SC @ 20 ml per acre in 200 litres of water, and you can also broadcast granular insecticides such as Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR @ 4 kg per acre or Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg per acre. For controlling Brown Plant Hopper, spray insecticide such as Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 40-50 ml per acre in 200 litres of water  or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 grams per acre in 200 litres of water. Apply Flubendiamide 39.35 SC @ 20 ml per acre in 200 litres of water for controlling leaf folders.  Paddy is harvested when grains turn golden yellow and have 20\u201324% moisture content. After threshing, the grains should be dried to 14% moisture for safe storage. For controlling sheath blight, spray Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 80 grams per acre. In case of false smut, spray Tebuconazole 25% EC @ 400 ml per acre. In case of leaf blast incidence, spray Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25%  @ 80 grams per acre or Carbendazim 50 WP @ 400 grams per acre in 200 litres of water. Paddy is harvested when grains turn golden yellow and have 20\u201324% moisture content. After threshing, the grains should be dried to 14% moisture for safe storage."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended cultural practices for Paddy under SRI system?","Final Answer":"The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a climate-smart, sustainable methodology for rice cultivation that enhances crop yield while using fewer seeds, less water, and minimal chemical inputs. First, prepare a nursery bed that is 3 feet wide and as long as needed. Lay a plastic sheet on a slightly sloped area and apply a 2\u20133 cm layer of the mixture. The bed mixture should consist of soil, organic fertilizer, and rice bran\/sawdust\/cocopeat in a 50:25:25 ratio. Scatter 50 grams of sprouted paddy seeds per square meter and cover the seeds with straw. An area of 45\u201360 square meters is required for planting one acre of land. Transplant very young seedlings, typically 8\u201312 days old, to reduce transplant shock and encourage vigorous growth. Generally, a seedling with 2\u20133 leaves is considered ideal for transplanting. Plant single seedlings in a square grid pattern per hill with wider spacing (25 cm \u00d7 25 cm or 10\" \u00d7 10\") to reduce competition among plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight. Use 2\u20133 kg of seed for planting one acre of land. Follow Intermittent Irrigation (Alternate Wetting and Drying) to maintain soil moisture without continuous flooding, thereby conserving water and reducing methane emissions. Maintain 16 plants per square meter. To prevent seed-borne diseases, treat the seeds with 2 grams of Carbendazim per kilogram of seed. Using 25\u201330% organic fertilizer is essential in the SRI method. You can use cow dung, compost, decomposed leaf manure, vermicompost, or oilseed cake. Organic fertilizer should be mixed into the soil 8\u201310 days before transplanting to allow it to decompose. Weeding can be easily done with a weeding machine such as a cono weeder, due to the ample space around each plant. The first weeding should be done 14 days after transplanting, followed by subsequent weedings at 21 and 28 days. For basal application, apply 60 quintals of well-decomposed cow dung manure per acre. In the Kharif season, apply 9 kg of urea, 9 kg of phosphate, and 6 kg of potash per acre as basal fertilizer. For the first top dressing, apply 4.5 kg of nitrogen (equivalent to 10 kg of urea) per acre 10\u201315 days after transplanting. For the second top dressing, apply 4.5 kg of nitrogen (10 kg of urea) per acre 20\u201325 days after transplanting. For the third top dressing, apply 4.5 kg of nitrogen (10 kg of urea) and 3 kg of potash (5 kg of MOP) per acre, 35\u201340 days after transplanting or just before the panicle initiation stage. This method increases yield by 20\u201350% or more compared to conventional practices. The amount of water needed is reduced by 40\u201350%. You don\u2019t need to keep water standing in the field, but ensure the soil remains moist. It also reduces the cost of seeds, water, and fertilizers."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control panicle blast in Rice?","Final Answer":"Lesions on the rice panicle often start as small, spindle-shaped or elliptical, grayish or whitish spots with dark brown or reddish borders. The infected spikelets or grains on the panicle may turn white and become sterile, appearing as \"white heads,\" leading to significant yield loss. Infected grains may be lightweight, empty, and shriveled. To control this disease, an integrated disease management approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended. The most economical way to prevent panicle blast is by planting rice varieties that are known to be resistant to the disease in your area, such as BRRI Dhan-69, CR Dhan-401(IET 19969), CR Dhan 407, CR Dhan 511, CR Sugandh Dhan 908, DRH-775 (IET 19741), Kanak(IET 19986) and Swarna unnat Dhan. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization; apply nitrogen in three split doses at recommended levels to reduce disease risk. Practice crop rotation and remove infected plant debris and weeds to reduce inoculum sources. Maintain proper water management by keeping fields optimally flooded, but avoid water stress and excessive moisture that favors disease development. Treat seeds with Captan or carbendazim @ 2-2.5 grams per kg of seed. In case of severe infestation, spray Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25%  @ 80 grams per acre in 200 litres of water or Carbendazim 50 WP @ 400 grams per acre in 200 litres of water, or Trifloxystrobin 25% + Hexaconazole 25% WG @ 80 grams per acre in 200 litres of water. Alternatively, you can spray leaf extracts of Bael (25  grams fresh leaves) or Tulsi (25 grams fresh leaves) or Neem (200 grams fresh leaves) per litre of water, which can help in reducing the incidence of disease. Also, you can use a biocontrol agent like Trichoderma viride  @ 2 kg\/acre in 200 litres of water. Carbendazim usage is under restriction and should be applied only with expert supervision."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the correct time of harvesting?","Final Answer":"For Aman (Kharif) paddy, which is sown in June\u2013July during the monsoon season, harvesting typically occurs in November\u2013December.For Boro (Rabi) paddy, which is irrigated and sown around November\u2013December, harvesting occurs in April\u2013May.Aus paddy (Jayad) is another season where sowing happens in March\u2013April and harvesting occurs around July\u2013August.\n"}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended time of first Top dressing application?","Final Answer":"The first top dressing of fertilizer in paddy is typically applied during the active tillering stage, around 25 to 30 days after transplanting (DAT). This stage is critical for stimulating the production of tillers\u2014side shoots that significantly contribute to the final number of grain-bearing panicles, thereby affecting overall yield. Nitrogen is the key nutrient needed at this point, and urea is commonly used as the source. At this stage, apply 10-12 kg of nitrogen per acre, usually using 22-27 kg of urea. Apply the fertilizer evenly in standing water or just before re-flooding after temporary drainage to improve uptake and reduce nitrogen loss. In sandy soils, consider splitting the dose further due to faster nutrient loss. To increase efficiency, urea can be mixed with moist soil or neem cake before application."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended fertilizer dose in Paddy field?","Final Answer":"For successful rice cultivation, an appropriate fertilizer schedule is crucial to meet the crop's nutrient requirements. To fulfill the nitrogen requirement of 40 kg per acre, approximately 87 kg of urea should be applied, considering that urea contains 46% nitrogen. This application should be split into three doses: 50% (about 43\u201344 kg) as a basal dose at the time of transplanting, 25% (around 22 kg) at the tillering stage, and the remaining 25% (22 kg) at panicle initiation. For phosphorus, 125 kg of Single Super Phosphate (SSP), which contains about 16% phosphorus, should be applied entirely as a basal dose during the final puddling before transplanting. Potassium requirements can be met by applying 40 kg of Muriate of Potash (MOP), which contains 60% potash. This should be split into two equal doses of 20 kg each\u2014one at transplanting and the other at panicle initiation. Zinc should be applied at 10 kg per acre using zinc sulfate heptahydrate or 6.5 kg if using the monohydrate form, also as a basal dose. In case zinc deficiency symptoms appear, a 0.5% foliar spray of zinc sulfate can be applied during the tillering and panicle initiation stages. Additionally, 8 kg per acre of sulfur should be applied using sources like gypsum or ammonium sulfate to ensure balanced nutrition."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowing of leaf in Paddy seedbed?","Final Answer":"Yellowing leaves in paddy seedbeds can be caused by nutrient deficiencies, diseases, insect pests, or environmental stress. Nitrogen deficiency affects older leaves and can be managed with urea at 30\u201335 kg\/acre or 1% foliar spray (10 g\/l water). Iron deficiency appears in young leaves and is corrected with 1% ferrous sulfate spray (10 g\/l water). Zinc deficiency shows as stunted patches and white streaks on middle leaves; treat with zinc sulfate at 10\u201315 kg\/acre or 0.5% foliar spray + 1% urea. Sulfur deficiency causes yellowing of young leaves and is managed with ammonium sulfate at 40\u201350 kg\/acre or gypsum at 80\u2013100 kg\/acre. Tungro virus causes yellow-orange leaves and stunting; control vectors with imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 50-60 ml\/acre or thiamethoxam 25% WG at 80 g\/acre, and remove infected plants. Bacterial leaf blight causes yellowing and wilting; manage with drainage and copper oxychloride 50% WP at 500 g\/acre. Seedling blight causes rot and chlorosis; improve drainage and water management. Environmental issues like waterlogging or excess chemicals can mimic deficiencies. Proper diagnosis and timely management using recommended doses ensure healthy seedlings."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dose of chemical fertilizers for Paddy cultivation in the absence of soil testing?","Final Answer":"In the absence of a soil test, a blanket fertilizer recommendation for high-yielding paddy is 60:20:20 kg per acre of NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium), which can be applied using standard fertilizers. This translates to approximately 132 kg of urea for nitrogen, 44 kg of DAP for phosphorus, and 34 kg of MOP for potassium per acre. At the time of transplanting (basal application), apply the full dose of DAP (44 kg) and half the MOP (17 kg). Around 15\u201320 days after transplanting, during the tillering stage, apply half the urea (66 kg). The remaining urea (66 kg) and MOP (17 kg) should be applied at panicle initiation, about 45\u201350 days after transplanting. If zinc deficiency is observed, apply 10 kg of zinc sulfate per acre before transplanting, mixed with sand. Additionally, a general micronutrient mixture at 5 kg per acre, enriched with farmyard manure (FYM), can help address minor nutrient deficiencies. While these recommendations are helpful, soil testing is essential to avoid nutrient imbalances, reduce environmental harm, and optimize yield and input costs."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowing in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Yellowing in paddy plants can be caused by nutrient deficiencies, pests, diseases, or environmental stress. Nitrogen deficiency leads to yellowing of older leaves and is corrected by applying urea in split doses or 1% foliar spray. Zinc deficiency, common in high-pH or flooded soils, causes rusty-brown spots and is managed with 10 kg zinc sulfate + 20 kg sand per acre before transplanting, or 0.5% foliar sprays every 10\u201315 days. Iron deficiency shows as interveinal yellowing in alkaline soils and is treated with 1% ferrous sulfate sprays at 2-week intervals. Among diseases, Tungro virus, spread by green leafhoppers, causes yellow-orange leaves and stunting. It\u2019s managed by insecticides like Thiamethoxam or Imidacloprid, resistant varieties, and weed control. Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) causes yellow lesions and is controlled with good drainage, copper fungicides (Copper Oxychloride 500 g\/acre), and balanced fertilization. Integrated management\u2014using certified seeds, proper spacing, soil testing, and regular monitoring\u2014is key to accurate diagnosis and timely intervention."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowing and drying of leaf in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Yellowing and drying in paddy fields can be caused by nutrient deficiencies or diseases, and effective management requires an Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM) approach with specific doses for treatments. For nutrient deficiencies, zinc deficiency (yellowing in young leaves) is managed by applying zinc sulfate at 10 kg per acre to the soil before transplanting or spraying a solution of 5 g zinc sulfate plus 2.5 g slaked lime per liter of water in the nursery. Nitrogen deficiency (yellowing in older leaves) is controlled by using a leaf color chart to guide split nitrogen fertilizer applications during vegetative and panicle initiation stages (dose varies by soil test but is typically around 40-60 kg N per acre in splits). Iron deficiency (yellowing between veins in young leaves) is treated with foliar sprays of ferrous sulfate at a 1% solution, applied two to three times at 10\u201314 day intervals. Diseases also contribute significantly to yellowing and drying in rice crops. Disease management includes controlling sheath blight with fungicides like Hexaconazole 5% EC at 400 ml\/acre or Propiconazole 25% EC at 300 ml\/acre. Viral diseases like Tungro, spread by leafhoppers, are managed through insecticide applications such as Imidacloprid 17.8% SL at 40-50 ml\/acre, Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40 g\/acre, or Buprofezin 25% SC at 150-200 g\/acre, along with planting resistant varieties. Additionally, seeds should be treated with fungicides like Thiram at 2.5-3 g per kg of seed before sowing to prevent seed-borne diseases. Cultural practices such as balanced fertilization, proper water management, and field sanitation also play key roles in disease prevention and crop health."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended time for herbicide application?","Final Answer":"Herbicide application timing for paddy varies depending on whether pre-emergence or post-emergence herbicides are used. Pre-emergence herbicides, such as pretilachlor, butachlor, or pendimethalin, are applied before weeds emerge\u2014typically 3 to 5 days after transplanting in transplanted rice and 5 to 8 days after sowing in direct-seeded rice. For best results, these should be applied when there is a thin film of water on the field, and the water should not be drained for at least two days after application. Post-emergence herbicides target actively growing weeds and are usually applied between 15 and 25 days after transplanting or sowing, when weeds are at the 2- to 4-leaf stage (7 days after transplanting). Specialized herbicides like bispyribac sodium can be applied earlier at the 2- to 3-leaf stage of weeds. For effective weed control, a sequential application is often recommended\u2014starting with a pre-emergence herbicide a few days after transplanting or sowing, followed by a post-emergence herbicide about 20 days later. It is important to choose the appropriate herbicide based on the weed type present, apply it on sunny days, use the correct sprayer and nozzle, and always follow label instructions for the best results."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is an SRI method kit?","Final Answer":"An SRI method kit is a set of tools and equipment designed to help farmers implement the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), a farming methodology that uses fewer resources to increase the productivity of rice. While SRI is not a single standardized technology, a kit typically includes the tools needed to carry out its core principles. Core components of an SRI kit are mechanical weeder, marker, specialized seed trays and instructional materials. Mechanical weeder is a key tool, often a rotary or cono-weeder, that is pushed between rows of rice plants. It aerates the soil, controls weeds and churns organic matter back into the soil to improve fertility. A marker is used to create a square grid pattern in the field before transplanting. This allows for wider, more precise spacing between seedlings, which is a fundamental practice of SRI. Some kits include nursery trays or frames for raising seedlings on a bed of soil mix. This allows for easy removal of very young seedlings, which are used in SRI. Kits often include guidelines, manuals, or training materials to teach farmers how to apply the specific management practices of the SRI method. In SRI method, farmers transplant 8- to 12-day-old seedlings with only two leaves, as opposed to the older seedlings used in conventional methods. The tools help handle these delicate plants with minimal damage to their roots. Seedlings are planted singly and widely spaced in a square pattern (e.g., 25x25 cm), which encourages stronger root and canopy development. The marker helps achieve this precise spacing. The absence of continuous flooding can increase weed growth. The mechanical weeder helps manage weeds effectively and provides the added benefit of soil aeration, which stimulates root growth and microbial activity. Many practitioners use organic materials like compost, which can be incorporated into the soil during weeding. Benefits of the SRI method using a kit includes higher yields, reduced costs, less water consumption and improved soil health."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended age of Paddy seedlings for transplanting?","Final Answer":"The recommended age of paddy seedlings for transplanting depends on the method you use. For traditional transplanting, seedlings should be 20\u201325 days old, healthy and about 6\u20138 inches tall. For delayed transplanting, use up to 25-30 day old seedlings of early or medium varieties and 45-50 day old seedlings for long-duration varieties. In the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method, very young seedlings of 8\u201312 days old, with just 2\u20133 leaves are used for transplanting because they grow faster, develop stronger roots and give higher yields. For direct seeded rice (DSR), there is no transplanting, but seedlings are sown directly in the field. Using the right seedling age ensures better establishment, uniform growth and higher grain production."}

Choosing these tested varieties and giving proper care helps you secure a good yield and better returns from their middle land."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Why are my paddy seedlings drying after applying urea, and what is the solution?","Final Answer":"Rice seedlings mostly dry or stop growing after urea because of ammonia toxicity, which happens when urea breaks down fast and releases ammonia gas, especially if the soil is dry or urea is placed too close to young roots. This gas burns the roots, reduces water and nutrient uptake, and seedlings either look weak, stunted, or dry up. The problem is worse if urea is applied at the time of seeding or very early in nursery or dry direct-seeded rice, when roots are most sensitive. If water is not given immediately after urea, ammonia volatilization increases and injury becomes severe. Farmers can avoid this by never applying urea at seeding time; instead, give the first dose after 10\u201315 days of seedling emergence when plants are established. Always irrigate the field just after spreading urea so that it mixes with the soil. Deep placement of urea is safer than broadcasting on dry soil. You may use urease inhibitors like NBPT or go for ammonium sulfate or slow-release urea in the early stage to reduce damage. Practically, the simple rule is don\u2019t give urea to very small seedlings, always ensure moisture in the soil, and place it a little deeper. This way, seedlings will stay green and grow properly, and you won\u2019t face drying or poor establishment."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can I transplant 40-day-old seedlings into the field?","Final Answer":"According to ICAR\u2019s recommendation, the best age for transplanting rice seedlings is 25\u201330 days, because at this stage the plants are soft, healthy, and make more tillers, which gives a higher yield. If seedlings become 40 days old due to a delay, then it is not ideal, but you can still manage it with some adjustments in the field. For such seedlings, transplant at a closer spacing of 15 x 15 cm instead of 20 x 15 cm, and put 4\u20135 seedlings per hill instead of 2\u20133, so that the loss of tillers can be covered. The field should be well puddled, levelled, and kept moist, and you must give irrigation immediately after transplanting so that the seedlings recover faster and reduce stress. For long-duration varieties, you can even use seedlings up to 45\u201350 days old with this same method. So, while timely transplanting at 25\u201330 days is always best, if seedlings are 40 days old, you can still get a good crop by using closer spacing, more seedlings per hill, and proper water management, which helps to reduce yield loss and establish the crop successfully in the field."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What fertilizers should be applied to the Paddy crop?","Final Answer":"Fertilizer management in paddy is important to supply the right nutrients at the right time, which ensures healthy crop growth and higher yield. For paddy cultivation in rainfed areas, give 32\u201340 kg nitrogen (70\u201387 kg urea), 16\u201324 kg phosphorus (35\u201352 kg DAP), and 8\u201316 kg potash (13\u201327 kg MOP) per acre. For paddy cultivation in lowland areas, give 40\u201348 kg nitrogen (87\u2013104 kg urea), 16\u201324 kg phosphorus (35\u201352 kg DAP), and 12\u201316 kg potash (20\u201327 kg MOP) per acre. Apply nitrogen (urea) in three equal splits: at sowing, at active tillering, and at the panicle initiation stage. Use zinc sulfate at 8 kg\/acre as a basal dose along with NPK fertilizers for better crop growth. Prolonged rice cultivation depletes organic matter and nutrients in the soil. Incorporate green manures (e.g., sunhemp, dhaincha, or leguminous crops) to improve soil health. Practice crop rotation with pulses to enhance soil fertility. Residue recycling and application of organic manure. Apply well-decomposed FYM (farmyard manure) at 2-4 tonnes per acre. This balanced dose of urea, DAP, and MOP will keep the crop healthy, ensure good tillering, and increase grain yield."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowing of Paddy?","Final Answer":"Yellowing in paddy leaves may be due to several reasons, such as nutrient deficiency (nitrogen, zinc, iron, magnesium), water stress, and pest and disease attack, so proper diagnosis is key for control. If yellowing symptoms appear on older leaves under the lower side with poor tillering, then it is due to nitrogen deficiency. To correct this, apply urea @ 35-50 kg per acre as top dressing, or you can apply a foliar spray of 2 % urea solution(20 grams per litre of water). If yellowing appears on younger leaves while the veins remain green, it is due to Iron deficiency. To correct this, use a foliar spray of ferrous sulphate 0.5 % (5 grams per litre of water) 2-3 times at a 15-day interval. If yellowing symptoms appear on lower leaves with a brown, rusty appearance during the early stage, it may be due to zinc deficiency. To correct this, use a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulphate(5 grams per litre of water). Water stress or over-irrigation can cause yellowing in paddy leaves. To control this, maintain a 2-3 cm water level in the field, especially during the early growth stage and avoid over irrigation or long dry spells. If the symptoms are characterised by water-soaked spots that turn yellow along leaf margins and dry, then it may be due to bacterial blight disease. To control this, spray Copper Hydroxide 53.8% DF @ 600 grams per acre in 200 litres of water, or Copper Sulphate Pentahydrate 6% SC @ 400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the recommended fertilizers dose?","Final Answer":"For a 100 square meter nursery seedbed, apply 1 kg Nitrogen (2.2 kg Urea), 1 kg Phosphorus (6.25 kg SSP), and 1 kg Potash (1.7 kg MOP) 15 days after sowing the seeds. It is always advisable to do a soil test before applying fertilizer in the main field, as it helps determine the exact fertilizer requirement based on the soil\u2019s nutrient status, avoiding both deficiency and excess use. For upland and early maturing varieties, apply 32:16:8 NPK per acre, which is equal to about 70 kg Urea, 100 kg SSP, and 13-14 kg MOP. For improved and hybrid varieties, use 40:16:8 NPK per acre, equivalent to 88 kg Urea, 100 kg SSP, and 14 kg MOP. For dwarf varieties, apply 32:16:8 NPK per acre, which comes to around 70 kg Urea, 100 kg SSP, and 14 kg MOP. For tall varieties, use 16:12:8 NPK per acre, equal to about 35 kg Urea, 75 kg SSP, and 14 kg MOP. Apply half of the Urea, along with the full dose of Potash and Phosphorus, at the time of sowing. Apply one-fourth of the Urea at 25\u201330 days after transplanting, and the remaining Urea at the time of ear emergence. It is also mandatory to incorporate 4\u20136 tons of farmyard manure (FYM) per acre about 25 days before transplanting. In case of micronutrient deficiency, apply Zinc Sulphate @ 10 kg per acre, at the time of final ploughing before sowing. For varieties with a duration of 150 days or more, apply Urea in four equal splits: one-fourth before transplanting, the second one-fourth at 3\u20134 weeks after transplanting, the third one-fourth at 6\u20137 weeks after transplanting, and the last one-fourth at 7\u20138 weeks after transplanting. In case of direct-seeded rice, apply approximately 49:24:16 NPK per acre. This is equivalent to about 108 kg of Urea, 150 kg of SSP, and 27 kg of MOP per acre. Apply one-third of the Urea along with the full dose of SSP and MOP at the time of sowing. Apply the remaining Urea in two equal splits\u2014one at seedling emergence and the second at the initial stage of ear formation. Nitrogen should be applied in the evening if there is no standing water in the field."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control insects in Paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"The major insects that affect paddy cultivation are Brown Leafhopper, Green Leafhopper, Yellow stemborer, and Leaf folder. Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) is a major pest, especially in irrigated rice fields with high nitrogen fertilization. They suck sap from plants, and in severe infestation, they cause \"hopper burn,\" a symptom where large patches of the field turn yellow and then brown, appearing scorched. Like BPH, Green Leafhopper is also a sucking pest that causes yellowing and white patches on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. To control these pests, an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, biological, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended. Avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers, maintain proper plant spacing, drain the field for 3-4 days when heavy infestation occurs, synchronise planting within your rice field, remove weeds and residues from the field and around bunds, and encourage and conserve natural predators such as spiders, ladybird beetles, and wasps. In case of severe infestation, spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 40-50 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 40 days), or Flonicamid 50 WG @ 60 grams per acre in litres of water (PHI 36 days), or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 grams per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 14 days). Yellow Stemborers larvae bore into the rice stems, leading to \u201cDead Hearts\u201d(during vegetative stage, the central shoot of the plant dries up and turns yellow, then brown), and \"White Earhead\" (during reproductive stage, the panicle turns completely white and stands upright with empty, sterile grains). To manage this pest, clip the seedlings of the tips before transplanting, which reduces the carryover eggs from the seedbed, and destroy stubble after harvest by tillage followed by flooding. Rice varieties with short stature and short duration are generally less affected by stemborers, and install pheromone traps @ 4-6 per acre to monitor and trap adult moths. In case of severe infestation, spray chemical insecticides such as Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 47 days), or Flubendiamide 39.35 SC @ 20 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 40 days), or Flubendiamide 20 WG @ 50 grams per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 30 days). You can also broadcast granular insecticides such as Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR @ 4 kg per acre (PHI 53 days) or Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg per acre (PHI 32 days) at 20-25 days after transplanting (DAP), targeting the early larval stages of stem borer evenly on the surface of the flooded paddy field. Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance. Rice leaf folder larvae fold leaves to feed inside, causing leaf damage and whitening, reducing the photosynthetic area. To control this pest, avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers, remove the cause of shedding within the fields, maintain wider spacing (22.5 x 20 cm and 30 x 20 cm), remove and destroy infested leaves, encourage natural predators such as spiders, predatory beetles, and wasps that attack leaf folder larvae, and in case of severe infestation, spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.50  SC @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 47 days), or Flubendiamide 39.35 SC 2 20 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 40 days) or Flubendiamide 20 WG @ 50 grams per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 30 days). Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control spider in Paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"Spiders in paddy fields are generally considered beneficial natural predators, not pests. They feed on many harmful insect pests such as planthoppers, leafhoppers, and other herbivorous insects. Spiders play an important role in the biological control of pest populations in rice ecosystems. Instead of controlling spiders, effective pest management protects and encourages spider populations to enhance their natural control of harmful insects. Spiders regulate insect pests by preying on them. They occupy various microhabitats within rice fields and have a wide range of prey species. Higher spider densities can significantly suppress pest populations like brown planthoppers, sometimes reducing the need for insecticides. When spider populations are high before pest immigration, they can control pests effectively, which may diminish or replace the need for chemical control. Examples of spider predation: Wolf Spiders: prey on stem borer and leaf folder moths, leafhoppers, and planthoppers, Lynx Spiders: prey on leafhoppers and planthoppers, Long-jawed Spiders: prey on stem borer and leaf folder moths. Orb Spiders: prey on rice grasshoppers. To protect and conserve spiders: minimise insecticide use, especially early in the season. Integrate rice fields into diverse landscapes with nearby habitats such as gardens, grasslands, or forests to provide food sources and refuges. Adopt organic or eco-friendly management practices rather than pesticide-intensive methods. Place straw bundles (rice or sorghum) in the field to provide excellent habitat for spiders. Plant flowering vegetation on bunds to attract alternative prey and sustain spider populations when rice pests are scarce."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage False smut in the paddy crop?","Final Answer":"False smut is a significant disease that affects the grains, transforming them into yellowish-orange smut balls. For controlling it, begin with cultural practices as the first line of defense. Use certified seeds of resistant or tolerant varieties, like BRR-0060, BRR-0078, and Rajendra Suwasini. Avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, as high nitrogen levels increase the crop's susceptibility to the disease. Ensure proper field sanitation by collecting and destroying the infected smut balls before they sporulate. This helps reduce the source of inoculum for the next season. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle. For chemical control, fungicide application is most effective at the boot leaf stage, just before the panicles emerge. You can use Propiconazole 25% EC is a commonly recommended fungicide. The dose is 1 ml\/liter of water. For one acre, use 200 ml in 200 liters of water. The recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) is 30 days. Hexaconazole 5% EC is another effective option. The dose is 2 ml\/liter of water. For one acre, use 350-400 ml in 200 liters of water. The recommended PHI is 30 days. Azoxystrobin 23% SC can also be used. The dose is 1 ml\/liter of water. For one acre, use 200 ml in 200 liters of water. The recommended PHI is 35 days. A combination product like Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP is also effective. The dose is 1.5-2 grams per liter of water. For one acre, use 350-400 grams in 200 liters of water. The recommended PHI is 40 days. Always wear protective clothing, including gloves and a mask, during the mixing and spraying process. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action in subsequent seasons to prevent the development of resistance in the fungus."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Cultivation of paddy","Final Answer":"Paddy cultivation in Bihar is primarily practiced during the Kharif season, with the timing of operations critical for success. The recommended soil type for paddy is medium- to heavy-textured soil, such as clay loam, which has good water-holding capacity. Land preparation involves plowing and puddling the field to create a soft, level seedbed. Proper leveling ensures uniform water distribution. The ideal time for transplanting is between June 15th and July 15th. Late transplanting after July significantly reduces yield. Irrigation should be managed to maintain a shallow depth of 2-5 cm of water in the field until the flowering stage. After flowering, irrigation can be applied at intervals to keep the soil saturated. Avoid continuous waterlogging. For nutrient management, a general recommendation is to apply 40-50 kg of nitrogen, 20-25 kg of phosphorus, and 20 kg of potash per acre. Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure at 3-4 tonnes per acre before transplanting. For major pests and diseases, chemical control measures are as follows: For stem borers, you can use Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at 40-50 ml per acre. The Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) is 47 days. For brown plant hopper control, use acetamiprid 20% SP at 40-60 grams per acre. The PHI is 07 days. For false smut control, use propiconazole 25% EC at 150-200 ml per acre. The PHI is 30 days.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Paddy cultivation by zero tillage method ","Final Answer":"Paddy cultivation using the zero-tillage method, specifically known as Direct Seeded Rice (DSR). This method is particularly suited for the dominant rice-wheat cropping system of the region. The traditional practice of puddling the field and transplanting seedlings is highly water-intensive and delays the sowing of the subsequent wheat crop. Zero-tillage addresses these issues by allowing farmers to sow paddy directly into the undisturbed soil immediately after harvesting the wheat crop. The procedure for zero-tillage paddy begins with the harvesting of the preceding crop using a combine harvester. It is important that the harvester is equipped with a straw management system that chops and evenly spreads the loose straw back onto the field. The next step involves the pre-germination of paddy seeds, which are soaked in water for about 24 hours and then kept in gunny bags for another 24 hours until small sprouts emerge. This machine performs multiple operations in one pass: its front blades cut and lift the wheat straw, a seed drill behind it places the pre-germinated seeds into the soil at the correct depth, and the machine then deposits the cut straw back over the sown area as a protective mulch. Immediately after sowing, the first irrigation is applied to ensure proper seed germination. Weed management becomes critically important in this system due to the absence of standing water that normally suppresses weeds. A pre-emergence herbicide is applied within two days of sowing, followed by careful monitoring and one or two manual weedings or a post-emergence herbicide application if necessary. The benefits of this method for Bihar are significant. It leads to substantial water savings of approximately 25-35 percent by eliminating the need for puddling and continuous flooding. It also reduces the cost of cultivation by saving on expenses related to labor for transplanting and fuel for repeated tillage. Furthermore, it improves soil health over time by preserving its structure and adding organic matter through the straw mulch. Most importantly, it completely eliminates the practice of burning paddy straw, thereby reducing air pollution and allowing the wheat crop to be sown in a more timely manner."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended Transplanting Time of sonam variety?","Final Answer":"\u201cSonam\u201d is a distinct cultivar that is similar in grain appearance to Bhagalpuri Katarni and has been used to adulterate it in markets in some areas. The ideal transplanting time for katarni rice is from the third week of June to the second week of July. Transplanting beyond mid-July significantly reduces the yield potential of these varieties. It takes approximately 130 to 140 days from transplanting to reach maturity and be ready for harvest. It is a traditional, indigenous variety known for its exceptional aroma and fine grain quality. It is primarily grown in the Bhagalpur and Banka regions and holds a Geographical Indication tag. Its average yield is lower than modern hybrids, ranging from 10 to 14 quintals per acre. These varieties are best suited to medium and lowland conditions with good water retention capacity.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding SRI method","Final Answer":"The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is an agro-ecological methodology for increasing the productivity of rice by changing the management of plants, soil, water, and nutrients. The core principles of SRI involve promoting root growth and enhancing the abundance and diversity of soil organisms. SRI is not a standardized technology but a set of adaptable practices based on specific principles. Firstly, the seedlings are transplanted at a very young age, typically 8-15 days old, when they have only two small leaves. This is in contrast to conventional methods where 25-40-day-old seedlings are used. Instead of planting multiple seedlings in a clump, only one single, healthy seedling is planted per hill. This reduces competition and allows each plant to develop stronger tillers and roots. Seedlings are transplanted in a square pattern, usually with a spacing of 25 cm x 25 cm or more. This wider spacing gives each plant more room for growth, allowing better access to light, air, and nutrients. After that, intermittent irrigation or alternate wetting and drying. The field is not kept continuously flooded. Instead, the soil is kept moist but not saturated, which improves soil aeration and root development. A special cono-weeder is used to aerate the soil and control weeds. This weeding is done 2-3 times during the vegetative growth stage. SRI strongly encourages the use of compost or well-rotted farmyard manure to improve soil health and structure. The benefits of SRI reported by farmers include reduced seed requirements, about 5-7 kg per acre compared to 20-30 kg in conventional methods. It also leads to water savings of about 25-50% due to the intermittent irrigation practice. SRI also promotes better root systems, making the plants more resilient to biotic and abiotic stresses like strong winds and drought."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to do seed treatment in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Seed treatment is a crucial and non-negotiable step in paddy (rice) cultivation. It is the most effective and economical method to protect seeds and seedlings from soil-borne diseases and to promote vigorous early growth. A comprehensive seed treatment for paddy should involve a combination of fungicides, insecticides (if needed for soil pests), and bio-fertilizers. Fungicidal Seed Treatment: Treat seeds with Carbendazim + Mancozeb @ 2 g\/kg of seed, or Thiram 75% WS @ 3 g\/kg of seed. Insecticidal Seed Treatment: Treat seeds with Thiamethoxam 70% WS @ 1 g\/kg of seed, or Imidacloprid 70% WS @ 3\u20135 g\/kg of seed (if soil pests are anticipated).

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about the Zinc dose in Paddy","Final Answer":"Zinc deficiency is a common problem in paddy fields, causing a disease called \u201cKhaira\u201d, which can significantly reduce yields. Zinc can be applied in two ways: 1. Basal Soil Application (Preventive Method): This is the most effective and recommended way to ensure zinc is available to the crop from the beginning. Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21% Zn) is most commonly used at 10 kg per acre. Apply it during the final stage of land preparation, just before transplanting. Mix the required amount of zinc sulphate with 20\u201325 kg of dry soil or sand to ensure even distribution, and broadcast it uniformly over the puddled field. This method is generally recommended once every three years or as per soil test results. Foliar Application (Curative Method): If symptoms of Khaira disease appear in the standing crop, apply one of the following foliar sprays per acre: 0.5\u20131 kg Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate (33%) + 1 kg Lime in 200 litres of water, or 2 kg Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) + 1 kg Lime in 200 litres of water. Lime is essential as it neutralizes the acidic effect of zinc sulphate, preventing leaf scorching or burning. Spray the solution thoroughly over the crop. The first spray should be applied as soon as the symptoms are observed. If necessary, a second and third spray can be given at 10\u201315 day intervals."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control the Gundhi bug in Paddy?","Final Answer":"The Gundhi bug (or rice earhead bug) is a major pest that attacks paddy during the milking stage. Both adults and nymphs suck the milky sap from developing grains, resulting in empty or partially filled, discoloured grains and a foul smell in the field. To control the Gundhi bug in paddy, an integrated approach should be used, combining field sanitation with targeted application of specific insecticides when the pest population reaches damaging levels. The Gundhi bug multiplies on various grasses before the paddy crop flowers. It is crucial to keep the field and surrounding bunds clean and free of weeds, such as barnyard grass (Echinochloa), to destroy the pest\u2019s alternate hosts. Timely planting is important, as it helps the crop pass through the vulnerable milking stage uniformly and quickly. Consolidated planting in a block at the same time across an area can also reduce overall pest incidence. ETL (Economic Threshold Level): 1 Gundhi bug per hill. If the population reaches or exceeds this level during the milking stage, chemical control is necessary. Chemical Control: Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 100 ml per acre (PHI: 15 days), Azadirachtin (Neem Oil) 1% EC @ 1000 ml per acre. Mix the insecticides in 200 litres of water and spray uniformly over the crop, focusing on the panicles. The dust formulation should be applied in the morning when there is dew on the plants for better adherence.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control redening in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Controlling the reddening of leaves in paddy requires first identifying the correct cause, as this is a symptom of several issues, not a single disease. The control measure depends entirely on proper diagnosis. The most common causes of reddish or orange discoloration in paddy are nutrient deficiencies, especially Phosphorus and Zinc. Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a common reason for reddening, particularly in young plants. The leaves turn dark green initially, then develop a purplish or reddish discoloration, starting from the older lower leaves and the stem. Plants may become stunted with poor tillering. For quick correction in a standing crop, apply a foliar spray of 2% DAP solution by dissolving 4 kg of Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) in 200 liters of water and spraying evenly over one acre. Zinc (Zn) deficiency, known as Khaira disease, is another major cause of discoloration in Bihar\u2019s paddy fields. It appears as rusty-brown to reddish-brown spots on the lower leaves, which may merge and cause the entire leaf to turn reddish or bronze. Growth is severely stunted. For quick correction, apply 0.5-1 kg Zinc Sulphate Mono Hydrate 33% mixed with 1 kg Lime in 200 liters of water per acre, or 2 kg Zinc Sulphate Hepta Hydrate 21% with 1 kg Lime in 200 liters of water per acre, as a foliar spray. Lime helps prevent leaf scorching. An insect pest, the Brown Plant Hopper (BPH), can cause 'hopper burn,' where plants rapidly dry out and turn reddish-brown. Look for small, brown insects at the base of plants. The affected crop dries in circular patches with a reddish-brown, burnt appearance. To control this, spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG at 40 grams per acre in 200 liters of water (PHI 21 days). For diseases like blast, sheath-blight, or panicle discoloration, spray Hexaconazole 5% SC at 400 ml per acre (PHI 40 days). Before spraying any chemicals, it is essential to confirm the cause. A soil test provides the most reliable understanding of nutrient deficiencies. You can have your soil tested at the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or a government agriculture office."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control insects in Paddy?","Final Answer":"To control insects in paddy, it is best to use an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach that combines cultural practices with the timely and judicious use of approved, safe insecticides. The key pests to watch for are the Yellow Stem Borer (YSB), Brown Plant Hopper (BPH), Gundhi Bug, and Rice Leaf Folder. Yellow Stem Borer (YSB)- This is one of the most damaging pests. The larva bores into the stem, causing \u201cdead hearts\u201d (central shoots drying up) in young plants and \u201cwhite ears\u201d (empty, white panicles) after flowering. To control this:Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre (PHI: 47 days), Cartap Hydrochloride 50% SP @ 400 g per acre (PHI: 21 days), Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 10 kg per acre (PHI: 32 days). Brown Plant Hopper (BPH)- These insects gather at the base of the plant and suck sap, causing the crop to yellow and dry up in circular patches \u2014 a condition known as \u201chopper burn.\u201d To control this: Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 40 g per acre (PHI: 21 days), Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 50\u201360 ml per acre (PHI: 40 days), Pymetrozine 50% WG @ 120 g per acre (PHI: 21 days). Gundhi Bug. Both adults and nymphs suck the milky sap from developing grains, leaving them empty or partially filled, and causing a foul odour in the field. To control this: Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 100 ml per acre (PHI: 15 days), Azadirachtin (Neem Oil) 1% EC @ 1000 ml per acre. ice Leaf Folder. The larva folds the leaf around itself and scrapes the green tissue, creating visible white scratch marks. To control this:Flubendiamide 20% WG @ 50 g per acre (PHI: 30 days), Cartap Hydrochloride 50% SP @ 400 g per acre (PHI: 21 days).

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information on the Insecticide spray schedule in Paddy","Final Answer":"A fixed, calendar-based insecticide spray schedule is not recommended for paddy cultivation. The modern and official Package of Practices (POP) advocates an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, where spraying is done only when the pest population reaches a specific damaging level, known as the Economic Threshold Level (ETL). This IPM-based approach saves costs, protects beneficial insects, and prevents pesticide resistance. Monitor your field regularly (at least once a week) to check pest levels. Spray only if the pest population crosses the ETL. Tillering Stage-This stage is crucial for the plant to produce a good number of productive tillers. Key Pests: Yellow Stem Borer (YSB), Leaf Folder. ETL: YSB: 1 moth per square meter or 5% \"dead hearts\" (dried central shoots) Leaf Folder: 1\u20132 freshly damaged leaves per hill. Panicle Initiation to Flowering Stage- Protecting the plant at this stage ensures the formation of healthy panicles (the flowering head). Key Pests: Yellow Stem Borer, Gundhi Bug. ETL: YSB: 5% \"white ears\" (empty,white panicles), Gundhi Bug: 1 bug per hill. Milking to Dough Stage. This is the grain-filling stage. Protecting the crop now ensures good grain quality and weight. Key Pests: Brown Plant Hopper (BPH), Gundhi Bug. ETL: BPH: 5\u201310 hoppers per hill (gently tap the plants to see if hoppers fall onto the water). Regular, unnecessary spraying kills natural enemies such as spiders, dragonflies, and predatory wasps that naturally control pest populations. Pests can develop resistance to insecticides used too frequently, making them ineffective in the future. Unwarranted spraying wastes money on chemicals and labour. It also increases the chemical load in the environment."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding weed management in paddy before the transplanting ","Final Answer":"Weed management before transplanting focuses on creating a weed-free seedbed using cultural and mechanical methods, supplemented by approved herbicides. The most effective strategy is the stale seedbed technique combined with a pre-plant herbicide. Begin with deep ploughing immediately after the first rains to expose weed seeds and underground propagules to sunlight, which desiccates and kills them. Allow the field to remain undisturbed for 10 to 15 days after ploughing. This encourages the germination of weed seeds. Perform shallow tilling or harrowing operations to destroy these newly germinated weeds. This significantly reduces the initial weed population. Ensure proper levelling of the field after these operations. A well-levelled field ensures uniform water distribution, which is crucial for effective weed control after transplanting. For chemical control, a pre-plant herbicide can be applied after the final land preparation but before transplanting. A recommended herbicide for this stage is Pendimethalin 30% EC at 2-3 ml\/litre of water. For one acre, using a spray volume of 200 litres of water, the required amount is 400-600 ml\/acre. An alternative is Oxadiargyl 80% WP, which is also used for pre-emergence control of grasses and broadleaf weeds. The dose for Oxadiargyl 80% WP is 0.5 grams per litre of water. For one acre, using 200 litres of water, the dose is 100 grams per acre. Apply it similarly as a pre-plant herbicide before transplanting.

This method supports healthy seedling growth before transplanting and is compatible with the principles of SRI, especially in conventional (non-organic) farming."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control dry ness of seedlings in Rice Nursery?","Final Answer":"Dryness of rice seedlings in nurseries is a common problem, especially during delayed monsoons or dry spells. To prevent this, it is essential to maintain consistent moisture by keeping a shallow layer of water (about 2.5 cm) in the nursery beds and irrigating regularly during dry periods. Proper sowing dates and assured irrigation help in raising healthy seedlings. Applying balanced NPK fertilizers at recommended rates promotes vigorous growth and root development, making seedlings more resilient to dryness. Foliar sprays of zinc sulfate (0.5% or 5 g per liter) can enhance seedling vigor and reduce stress effects. Additionally, practices like covering nurseries with light mulch (such as paddy straw) or using shade nets during hot weather can conserve moisture and reduce dryness. It is also important to distinguish dryness from cold injury, as the latter requires different management."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about SRI method in Rice?","Final Answer":"The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is an innovative farming technique designed to boost rice yields by changing how plants, soil, water, and nutrients are managed. The seed rate is 2 kg\/ac, and transplanting younger seedlings, typically 8 to 12 days old, at wider spacing (25*25 cm) promotes better root growth and air circulation. Instead of planting multiple seedlings together, single seedlings are transplanted. Water management is improved by using intermittent irrigation rather than continuous flooding, which helps aerate the soil. Additionally, SRI encourages the use of organic manures and bio-fertilizers to enhance soil fertility, along with manual or mechanical weeding to keep the soil healthy. This method has several benefits, including higher rice productivity, better water efficiency, stronger plants with improved resistance to pests and diseases, and reduced seed requirements compared to traditional practices."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to Control Atragine effect in Rice feilds if I use by mistake?","Final Answer":"If atrazine is mistakenly applied in rice fields, immediate action is necessary to reduce its harmful effects. First, flush the field with plenty of clean water to dilute and wash away the herbicide from the soil, reducing its uptake by the rice plants. Maintain continuous standing water (2\u20133 cm) to help lower atrazine availability. Remove and destroy any severely damaged plants to prevent further stress. Apply balanced fertilizers and foliar sprays of micronutrients like zinc and iron to support plant recovery and combat oxidative stress caused by atrazine. Adding organic matter, such as well-decomposed farmyard manure, can enhance soil microbial activity and help degrade atrazine residues faster. Regularly monitor the crop for symptoms like stunted growth or yellowing, and consult local agricultural experts for additional guidance. These steps can help mitigate the negative impact of atrazine and support the recovery of the rice crop."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the Nutirent schedule in Rice?","Final Answer":"In rice cultivation, the recommended nutrient application per acre is approximately 48.5 kg of nitrogen (N), 24.3 kg of phosphorus (P\u2082O\u2085), and 16.2 kg of potassium (K\u2082O). These essential nutrients are typically supplied through fertilizers like urea for nitrogen, DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) for phosphorus, and MOP (Muriate of Potash) for potassium. To meet this requirement, farmers may apply around 105 kg of urea, 53 kg of DAP, and 27 kg of MOP per acre.  Urea should be applied in three equal splits: the first at transplanting, the second at the active tillering stage, and the third at panicle initiation. DAP and MOP are usually applied as basal doses during final land preparation or transplanting. In addition to chemical fertilizers, incorporating organic manures or compost can improve soil structure, microbial activity, and overall fertility. It's always advisable to conduct a soil test before fertilization to determine the existing nutrient status and apply amendments like lime, boron, or zinc, if required, for balanced crop nutrition."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control redspots on leaves in paddy feilds?","Final Answer":"Red spots on paddy leaves are often caused by zinc deficiency, which commonly occurs in lowland and aerobic rice fields with high soil pH and intensive cereal cropping. Symptoms typically appear 2 to 3 weeks after transplanting, characterized by brown blotches and streaks on the leaves, which can lead to reduced plant growth, tillering, and grain yield. To control this disorder, it is important to apply zinc fertilizers early, preferably before or at transplanting. Zinc sulfate (ZnSO\u2084) is the preferred zinc source due to its water solubility and acidifying effect, with recommended application rates of 10 kgs of ZnSO\u2084 per acre once in 2-3 years for soil application, depending on soil test results. To avoid zinc fixation in alkaline soils, ZnSO\u2084 should be mixed with 25 kg of sand and applied uniformly, then incorporated into soil. Seedlings can also be treated with zinc oxide (ZnO) root dips at around 0.5% concentration to enhance early zinc uptake. Additionally, foliar sprays of water-soluble zinc sulfate at 0.5% concentration are effective, especially when applied 2 to 3 weeks after transplanting and again from the booting to blooming stages to enrich grain zinc content. Proper water management, maintaining favorable soil conditions for zinc availability, adding organic matter, and practicing crop diversification further help prevent zinc deficiency. Foliar spray of ZnSO\u2084 should always be done with 2.5 g lime per liter of spray solution to avoid leaf burn. These integrated measures promote healthier plants, improve yields, and enhance the nutritional quality of rice grains."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control red colouration of leaves?","Final Answer":"Paddy is grown in the Kharif season because it requires plenty of water and warm temperatures, which are available during the monsoon. The reddening of leaves in paddy may occur due to various factors such as nutrient deficiencies, disease infestations, or environmental stress. Reddening of leaves is mainly caused by nutrient deficiencies. Low phosphorus levels in the soil slow down plant metabolism, leading to reddish or purplish leaves, especially in young plants under cool conditions. This problem can also occur if the soil is too acidic or alkaline, roots are damaged, or waterlogged conditions limit nutrient uptake. To avoid this, ensure timely application of phosphorus fertilizers such as Single Super Phosphate (SSP) or DAP at recommended doses (27 kg DAP or 75 kg SSP per acre before puddling) during field preparation or early tillering. Maintain proper drainage and keep the crop free from prolonged standing water or root injury. These practices will help the leaves regain their healthy green color and improve overall plant growth."}

For paddy, the dose of DAP is 35 kg\/acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding SRI method","Final Answer":"The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a modern method of paddy cultivation that helps farmers get more yield with less seed, water and fertilizer. In this method, seedlings are first grown in a small nursery at a seed rate of about 2 kg per acre. Very young seedlings, usually 8\u201312 days old and at the 2-leaf stage, are transplanted instead of older ones, with only one seedling per hill. The spacing is kept wide, usually 25 \u00d7 25 cm, so that each plant gets enough sunlight, air and space to grow stronger roots and produce more tillers. Under SRI, fields should be well leveled and good organic manure like FYM or compost should be added to improve soil health. Water is not kept standing continuously; instead, the field is kept moist using alternate wetting and drying, which allows roots to breathe and grow better. Weeding is done more often with a simple rotary weeder or by hand to keep the field clean. Fertilizers, especially nitrogen, are applied in split doses during transplanting, tillering and panicle initiation stages. By following SRI, farmers can get stronger plants, more tillers, better grain filling and higher yields while saving water and reducing input costs. Although it requires careful management in the early stages, the results are highly beneficial and profitable for farmers."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to do insect management and control of False smut?","Final Answer":"The major insects that affect paddy cultivation are Brown Leafhopper, Green Leafhopper, Yellow stemborer, and Leaf folder. Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) is a major pest, especially in irrigated rice fields with high nitrogen fertilization. They suck sap from plants, and in severe infestation, they cause \"\"hopper burn,\"\" a symptom where large patches of the field turn yellow and then brown, appearing scorched. Like BPH, Green Leafhopper is also a sucking pest that causes yellowing and white patches on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. To control these pests, an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, biological, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended. Avoid excessive use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers, maintain proper plant spacing, drain the field for 3-4 days when heavy infestation occurs, synchronise planting within your rice field, remove weeds and residues from the field and around bunds, and encourage and conserve natural predators such as spiders, ladybird beetles, and wasps. In case of severe infestation, spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 40-50 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 40 days), or Flonicamid 50 WG @ 60 grams per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 36 days), or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 grams per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 14 days).                                                                                                                                                                                     Yellow Stemborers larvae bore into the rice stems, leading to \u201cDead Hearts\u201d(during vegetative stage, the central shoot of the plant dries up and turns yellow, then brown), and \"\"White Earhead\"\" (during reproductive stage, the panicle turns completely white and stands upright with empty, sterile grains). To manage this pest, clip the seedlings of the tips before transplanting, which reduces the carryover eggs from the seedbed, and destroy stubble after harvest by tillage followed by flooding. Rice varieties with short stature and short duration are generally less affected by stemborers, and install pheromone traps @ 4-6 per acre to monitor and trap adult moths. In case of severe infestation, spray chemical insecticides such as Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 47 days), or Flubendiamide 39.35 SC @ 20 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 40 days), or Flubendiamide 20 WG @ 50 grams per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 30 days). You can also broadcast granular insecticides such as Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR @ 4 kg per acre (PHI 53 days) or Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 6-8 kg per acre (PHI 32 days) at 20-25 days after transplanting (DAP), targeting the early larval stages of stem borer evenly on the surface of the flooded paddy field. Rotate insecticides to prevent resistance.Rice leaf folder larvae fold leaves to feed inside, causing leaf damage and whitening, reducing the photosynthetic area. To control this pest, avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers, remove the cause of shedding within the fields, maintain wider spacing (22.5 x 20 cm and 30 x 20 cm), remove and destroy infested leaves, encourage natural predators such as spiders, predatory beetles, and wasps that attack leaf folder larvae, and in case of severe infestation, spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.50  SC @ 60 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 47 days), or Flubendiamide 39.35 SC 20 ml per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 40 days) or Flubendiamide 20 WG @ 50 grams per acre in 200 litres of water (PHI 30 days).

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Can you provide me the information regarding SRI method?","Final Answer":"The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a climate-smart, sustainable methodology for rice cultivation that enhances crop yield while using fewer seeds, less water, and minimal chemical inputs. Transplant very young seedlings, typically 8-12 days old, to reduce transplant shock and encourage vigorous growth.  Planting single seedlings in a square grid pattern with wider spacing (25 cm X 25 cm) to reduce competition among plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight. Use 2 kg per acre for planting an acre of land. Utilise organic manure and minimize chemical fertilizer use to enhance soil biological activity and fertility. Follow Intermittent Irrigation (Alternate Wetting and Drying) to maintain soil moisture without continuous flooding, which conserves water and reduces methane emissions. Use mechanical weeders like the cono weeder to control weeds and aerate the soil, which stimulates root growth and nutrient uptake. This method increases yield by 20-50% or more compared to conventional practices. Saves water 20-50% due to intermittent irrigation. It also reduces costs for seeds, water, and fertilizers."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How many days does dapog method take to raise seedlings?","Final Answer":"The Dapog method of raising rice seedlings typically takes about 12 to 14 days to raise seedlings ready for transplanting. Seedlings in this method are usually small, tender, and have about 2-3 leaves at this stage. The Dapog nursery is constructed on a flat impermeable surface covered with banana leaves, plastic sheet, or other materials to avoid root penetration into the soil. This method is best suited for short-duration varieties and minimizes transplanting shock due to the young age and small size of the seedlings."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What to do when soil is not fertile?","Final Answer":"When your soil is not fertile for rice cultivation, a systematic approach combining organic matter addition and scientific testing is recommended for a one-acre plot. The first and most critical step is to conduct a soil test through a government laboratory or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra. A soil test will provide a precise analysis of nutrient deficiencies and soil pH, allowing for targeted amendment. Based on the test results, incorporate large quantities of organic matter to improve soil structure and nutrient content. Apply well-decomposed cow dung manure at a rate of 4 to 5 tons per acre during your final land preparation. Alternatively, or in combination, apply vermicompost at a rate of 1.5 to 2 tons per acre. These organic inputs increase the soil's water-holding capacity and stimulate beneficial microbial life. Consider growing a green manure crop, such as Sesbania or Dhaincha, and ploughing it into the soil 55-60 days after sowing, before transplanting rice. This practice significantly adds organic nitrogen and biomass to the soil. If the soil test reveals a zinc or boron deficiency, apply zinc sulphate at 10 kg per acre and borax at 1 to 1.5 kg per acre. Even when using organic manures, a balanced application of chemical fertilizers as per the soil test recommendation is often necessary for optimal yield. Finally, practice crop rotation in subsequent seasons with pulses like lentil or chickpea to naturally fix nitrogen and break pest cycles. For authoritative guidance and to get your soil tested, please contact your local agricultural office."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is Azolla?","Final Answer":"Azolla is a small floating fern that has gained attention for its multiple agricultural benefits. This fast-growing aquatic plant forms a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for farming systems. Farmers are increasingly adopting Azolla cultivation due to its cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. The primary advantage of Azolla lies in its nitrogen-fixing capability, which can contribute 10-12 kg of nitrogen per acre when used as green manure. This natural fertilization reduces dependence on chemical urea while improving soil health. The plant grows rapidly, doubling its biomass every 8-12 days under ideal conditions, providing a continuous organic input. For livestock, Azolla serves as an excellent nutritious feed containing 25-30% protein along with essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Dairy farmers report improved milk production when supplementing cattle feed with 1-2 kg of fresh Azolla daily. Poultry farmers can mix 5-10% dried Azolla into regular feed for better egg production. In rice cultivation, Azolla offers multiple benefits when grown as a dual crop. It forms a dense mat on water surfaces, suppressing weed growth by blocking sunlight. The floating layer also reduces water evaporation, helping conserve irrigation resources. When incorporated into soil, it decomposes quickly, releasing nutrients for the rice plants. Farmers can cultivate Azolla using simple pit methods requiring minimal infrastructure. A small 2 x 2 meter pit lined with plastic and filled with 10 cm of water serves as an effective production unit. Adding fertile soil and cow dung slurry provides necessary nutrients, while initial inoculation with 500 grams of fresh Azolla starts the culture. Regular harvesting every 10-15 days maintains vigorous growth. For field application in rice, farmers spread 200-300 kg of fresh Azolla per acre before transplanting. A second application after 3 weeks ensures a continuous nitrogen supply throughout the crop cycle. This practice can reduce chemical fertilizer requirements by 25-30%, offering significant cost savings. Government schemes under organic farming initiatives sometimes provide subsidies for establishing small Azolla units. Several progressive farmers in the state have successfully integrated Azolla into their farming systems. Economically, Azolla presents attractive benefits for farmers. As a biofertilizer, it can save Rs. 500-700 per acre on urea costs. As livestock feed, it reduces concentrate feed expenses by 20-30%. The low production cost and multiple uses make it particularly valuable for small and marginal farmers. The dual-purpose nature of Azolla\u2014as both organic fertilizer and animal feed\u2014makes it particularly suitable for integrated farming systems. Farmers practicing dairy along with crop production can especially benefit from this innovation. Research continues to optimize cultivation techniques for local conditions."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What to apply in SRI method?","Final Answer":"The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a set of practices designed to increase rice yields while using fewer inputs, like water and seeds. Prepare a small, raised nursery bed using organic matter, requiring only about 40 square meters, or one cent, of land for one acre. Use a significantly reduced seed rate of only 1.5 to 2 kilograms of seeds per acre. Transplant very young seedlings, ideally at the 8- to 12-day stage, to ensure high tillering potential. Handle seedlings carefully and transplant them quickly, with roots placed shallowly in the soil. Transplant single seedlings per hill in a square pattern with a wide spacing of 25 centimeters by 25 centimeters. This specific spacing results in approximately 64,000 individual plants per acre. Practice alternate wetting and drying of the field instead of continuous flooding. Irrigate to moisten the soil and then allow it to dry until small cracks appear before the next watering. Use a mechanical cono-weeder between the rows to control weeds and aerate the soil at regular intervals. Apply organic manure, such as well-decomposed compost or farmyard manure, to build healthy soil."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the recommended dosage of neem-coated Urea in Paddy field?","Final Answer":"For nutrient management in paddy, neem-coated urea is applied at 70\u2013130 kg per acre per crop season, depending on the variety and soil fertility. This quantity supplies the recommended nitrogen dose. The application should be done in three splits. \u00bd of the total dose as basal at final puddling\/transplanting, \u00bc of the dose at the tillering stage (20\u201325 days after transplanting), and \u00bc of the dose at the panicle initiation stage (40\u201345 days after transplanting). Neem coating improves nitrogen-use efficiency, reduces volatilization losses, and may allow a 10\u201320% reduction in total urea requirement compared to ordinary urea. Always apply when there is a thin film of water in the field for better uptake."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control Termites in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Controlling termites in rice fields requires an integrated approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods. Termites can be particularly damaging in upland and drought-affected lowland rice conditions. Deep summer plowing helps expose termite colonies to the sun and predators, significantly reducing their population. Removing and destroying termite mounds and queen cells from the field and its bunds is a crucial mechanical control method. Avoiding water stress by ensuring proper irrigation makes the crop less susceptible to termite attack. For chemical control, soil application of insecticides is the most effective direct method. Chlorpyriphos 10 G granules can be applied, which is approximately 3 kg per acre. Fipronil 0.3% G (use it under Agri expert advice) granules are another effective option, applied at 6 to 10 kg per acre. The pre-harvest interval, between the last application and harvest, for fipronil is 32 days. Always use fresh, approved insecticide formulations and follow the manufacturer's label instructions precisely. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I control yellowing of leaves in Paddy?","Final Answer":"In paddy, the yellowing of leaves is a common part. Observe the pattern of yellowing to identify the likely nutrient deficiency. Also, maintain irrigation. If the yellowing begins on the older, lower leaves and progresses upward, it is most likely a nitrogen (N) deficiency. The leaves may appear pale green to yellow overall. For controlling it, you can apply 15 to 20 kilograms of urea per acre as a top dressing. This provides approximately 7 to 9 kilograms of actual nitrogen per acre. Ensure the field has a thin layer of water during application for optimal uptake. If the yellowing appears between the veins of the youngest leaves, while the veins themselves remain green, this is interveinal chlorosis and suggests an iron (Fe) deficiency. For controlling it, you can apply a foliar spray of 1.0% ferrous sulfate solution. Dissolve 10 grams of ferrous sulfate in 1 liter of water. Spray this solution over one acre using a total spray volume of 200 liters of water. Two sprays at an interval of 10-15 days may be necessary. If the leaves are stunted and have a yellowish-orange or bronze discoloration, especially in the middle leaves, it could be a zinc (Zn) deficiency, and to control it, you can do soil application; for this, use 10 kilograms of zinc sulfate heptahydrate (21% Zn) per acre during the final land preparation. For a quick corrective measure, use a foliar spray. Dissolve 2 kg of zinc sulfate and 1 kg of unslaked lime (to prevent leaf burn), and spray this solution over one acre using a total spray volume of 200 liters of water. For a definitive diagnosis, a soil test conducted through your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or government agriculture office is highly recommended. If the yellowing is accompanied by distinct spots or lesions, it may be a disease like Brown Spot. In such cases, a fungicide application may be needed. A recommended fungicide is Hexaconazole 5% EC. The dose is 2 ml per liter of water. For one acre, use 300-400 mL in 200 liters of water. The recommended Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) is 30 days. Always practice good water management. Avoid continuous waterlogging, which can induce nutrient deficiencies, and also avoid drought stress. Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) at 4-5 tonnes per acre during land preparation to improve overall soil health and nutrient availability. Always wear protective gloves and a mask, and cover your skin during mixing and spraying."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How can I manage rats problem in Paddy?","Final Answer":"Rodents like rats damage crops, eat stored grain, and cut irrigation channels. To control them, keep field bunds clean, remove weeds and trash, and do deep ploughing before sowing to destroy burrows. Find active burrows and close or flood them. The acceptance of poison baits by rats and mice depends upon the quality, texture, taste and odour of the baiting materials, therefore, bait should be prepared as under: Zinc phosphide bait (2%): Take 1 kg of bajra or sorghum or cracked wheat or their mixture and mix it thoroughly with 20 g of edible vegetable oil, 20 g of powdered sugar and 25 g of 80% zinc phosphide powder.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding Khaira disease management","Final Answer":"Khaira disease in paddy is a physiological disorder, not a disease caused by a pathogen. It is a classic symptom of zinc deficiency in the rice plant. Symptoms typically appear within 10-15 days after transplanting. The younger leaves at the base of the plant turn a pale yellowish-green. As the deficiency worsens, small, rusty brown spots appear on the leaves. The plant's growth is severely stunted, and tillering is significantly reduced. The control of Khaira disease is primarily focused on correcting the zinc deficiency in the soil and the plant. The most common and effective method is to apply zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) @ 8-10 kg per acre during the last puddling or final land preparation before transplanting. This provides a slow, steady supply of zinc to the plants. If symptoms appear, spray the crop with a solution of 2 kg of zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21%) and 1 kg of slaked lime in 200 litres of water per acre. The first spray should be done as soon as you notice the symptoms. If the symptoms persist after 10-15 days, repeat the spray. Two to three sprays at intervals of 10 days may be required for a full recovery."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to plough the field to remove the seedlings easily?","Final Answer":"To efficiently remove unwanted seedlings (weeds) from a field by ploughing, the most effective method recommended by agricultural experts is the\u00a0Stale Seedbed Technique. This involves deliberately allowing a flush of weeds to grow and then destroying them with shallow ploughing just before planting your main crop. Plough the field as you normally would for crop sowing. This creates a fine, loose seedbed, which is ideal for weed seeds in the topsoil to germinate. After the initial ploughing, provide a\u00a0light irrigation\u00a0to the field. This moisture will prompt the germination of thousands of dormant weed seeds near the soil surface. Wait about\u00a07-10 days\u00a0for these unwanted seedlings to emerge and grow slightly. The field will look green with a carpet of young weeds. Destroy the unwanted seedlings; the best way to do this is with\u00a0shallow ploughing or harrowing. Use a tractor with a cultivator or a rotavator set to a shallow depth (only 2-3 inches).\u00a0"}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the irrigation schedule in Paddy?","Final Answer":"The irrigation for Paddy keeps a shallow 2\u20133 cm of water immediately after transplanting to settle seedlings, then maintains about 3\u20135 cm of standing water through the active vegetative period and critical reproductive stages, draining the field 7\u201310 days before harvest. The main stages of irrigation are establishment (0\u20137 DAT), during which you keep the soil saturated and avoid deep standing water. This ensures better root establishment after transplanting. For tillering (15\u201335 DAT), apply irrigation for 3\u20134 days after disappearance of ponded water in kharif and 1\u20132 days in rabi. Maintain 5\u20138 cm water depth after each irrigation. The third stage is Panicle Initiation (45\u201350 DAT), during which 5\u20138 cm of standing water is maintained continuously. This is a critical stage to avoid moisture stress. Booting (55\u201365 DAT) keeps 5\u20138 cm of standing water in the field. Irrigation at this stage supports spikelet development. The next stage is Heading (70\u201380 DAT), maintaining 5\u20138 cm of standing water. Continuous water is essential for proper grain setting. The last stage is Flowering\/Anthesis (80\u201390 DAT), which requires 5\u20138 cm of standing water without interruption. Moisture stress here can reduce yield by 50\u201360%."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control discolouring of Paddy leaf?","Final Answer":"Leaf discoloration in paddy is mainly caused by nutrient deficiencies, toxicities, or sometimes by diseases, and the approach to control it begins with a correct diagnosis of the underlying cause.\nNutrient deficiencies like nitrogen (yellowing of older leaves), potassium (tip and margin yellowing with rusty spots), magnesium (orange-yellow interveinal chlorosis), sulfur (general pale yellowing of younger leaves), zinc (bronzing and reddish blotches around the midrib), and iron (bleaching of young leaves) are all expressed as different forms of discoloration. \nOn the other hand, iron toxicity often appears as reddish-brown to purplish-brown patches, especially on older leaves. \nThe recommended control measures include adopting balanced fertilizer application based on soil test values, practicing integrated nutrient management (combining organic manures, green manures, biofertilizers, and chemical fertilizers), and splitting nitrogen and potassium applications instead of a single dose. \nFor rapid correction, foliar sprays such as 2% urea for nitrogen (4 kg urea\/acre), 0.5% zinc sulphate (1 kg zinc sulphate (ZnSO\u2084\u00b77H\u2082O) + 0.25 kg lime (to avoid leaf burn)), 1% ferrous sulphate (2 kg ferrous sulphate (FeSO\u2084\u00b77H\u2082O) + 0.5 kg lime) for iron, or magnesium chloride (2 kg magnesium chloride (MgCl\u2082) for magnesium deficiency in 200 liters of water). \nRecycling crop residues, returning rice straw to the soil, and applying sulfur (4-16 kg\/acre depending on severity) are also effective practices. \nIn areas with iron toxicity, management includes draining excess water to oxidize soluble iron, liming acid soils, applying additional potassium, manganese, or zinc, adjusting transplanting time to avoid peak toxic conditions, and selecting tolerant cultivars. \nWhere leaf discoloration is due to diseases like bacterial blight, blast, or brown spot, integrated measures such as using resistant varieties, maintaining balanced nutrition, and applying recommended plant protection measures are essential. Thus, controlling paddy leaf discoloration requires a combined strategy of accurate diagnosis, soil- and crop-specific nutrient management, corrective foliar feeding, water regulation, and, if needed, disease management to restore the plant\u2019s normal green leaf color and ensure healthy growth.\n"}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the dose of Zinc application in field?","Final Answer":"The zinc application dose for paddy cultivation is 10 kg zinc sulfate per acre per year as a soil application. For zinc deficiency in their paddy fields, this dose should be applied during final land preparation or as a basal application before transplanting. \nAdditionally, for initial correction of severe zinc deficiency, 4 kg of zinc sulfate per acre may be applied along with organic amendments like farmyard manure (2-4 tonnes per acre) for better long-term soil zinc availability. \nAlternative methods include foliar application of 0.5% zinc sulfate solution, that is, 1 kg of zinc sulfate per acre, dissolved in 200 liters of water. Around 2-3 sprays are needed during crop growth stages (at tillering, panicle initiation, and grain filling), or root dipping of seedlings in 2-3% zinc oxide solution (20-30 g per liter of water or 200-300 g for every 10 liters of water) before transplanting.\nZinc application significantly improves tiller production, grain yield, and overall paddy productivity while preventing zinc deficiency symptoms like 'khaira disease' commonly observed in calcareous soils.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weed problem in Paddy?","Final Answer":"In paddy fields, an integrated weed management approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective and economical. \nProper land preparation with leveling and puddling reduces weed emergence, while the stale seedbed technique\u2014preparing the field 2\u20133 weeks before sowing, allowing weeds to germinate, then destroying them with a non-selective herbicide like glyphosate before transplanting\u2014helps lower the initial weed load. Hand weeding remains important, with the first weeding at 20\u201325 days after transplanting (DAT) and the second at 40\u201345 DAT, which together can cut weed biomass by over 90% and boost yields significantly. \nFor chemical control, pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin 30% EC at 1.0 kg a.i.\/ha (\u22483.3 L\/ha or 1.3 L\/acre) within 2\u20133 days of sowing or transplanting effectively suppresses grasses and broadleaf weeds up to 30 DAT. For post-emergence, at 25\u201330 DAT when weeds are at the 2\u20134 leaf stage, a tank mix of Bispyribac Sodium 10% SC at 120 ml\/acre or Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9 EC at 260 ml\/acre at 20 days after in moist soil as an alternative to manual weeding.\n"}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control weed problem after 15 days of transplanting?","Final Answer":"At 15 days after transplanting (DAT) in paddy fields, weed control can be effectively managed using both mechanical and chemical methods. Bispyribac-sodium 10% SC, a post-emergence herbicide, should be applied at a rate of 100\u2013120 ml\/acre between 20 and 25 DAT and is effective against grasses, sedges, and broadleaf weeds. Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl 10% WP, targeting broadleaf weeds and sedges, can be applied at 40\u201350 g\/acre between 15\u201325 DAT, especially under a shallow water layer for better efficacy. Mechanical methods such as rotary or cono weeding should begin at 15 DAT and be repeated every 10 days until canopy closure. Hand weeding at 15 and 30 DAT remains labor-intensive but effective, particularly near crop rows where mechanical tools may not reach. Maintaining a shallow film of water during herbicide application enhances herbicide performance. Additionally, rotating herbicides helps prevent the development of resistance, and accurately identifying weed species is essential for selecting the most effective control strategy."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information about weeds","Final Answer":"Paddy fields face significant weed problems, including grasses like barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) and jungle rice, sedges such as purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus) and common sedge, and broad-leaved weeds like false daisy (Eclipta prostrata) and goat weed. These weeds compete with rice plants for nutrients, sunlight, and water, causing yield losses of 15% to over 50% if not controlled. They also lower grain quality and increase production costs. Weed management includes cultural practices like timely tillage, manual weeding at 20 and 45 days after sowing or transplanting, and maintaining 5\u20137 cm of standing water. For effective weed control in paddy fields, herbicides are applied based on weed type and timing. Bispyribac Sodium 10% SC (80 ml\/acre) targets early grasses and sedges at 10 days after transplanting (DAT). Ethoxysulfuron 15% WDG (40 g\/acre) controls sedges and broadleaved weeds at 15-18 DAT. Butachlor and pretilachlor are popular pre-emergence herbicides, applied soon after sowing or transplanting to suppress early weed growth, especially grasses and sedges. Butachlor is often used at doses around 400-600 g\/acre, while pretilachlor is applied at 250-300 g\/acre. Integrated Weed Management (IWM), which combines manual, cultural, and chemical methods, has proven most effective."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control yellowing of Paddy by Hopper?","Final Answer":"To effectively control the yellowing of paddy caused by hoppers, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods. Cultural practices include avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilizer by applying it in split doses, draining fields for 3\u20134 days during heavy infestations, optimizing plant spacing by leaving 30 cm alleyways every 2\u20133 meters, planting hopper-resistant rice varieties, synchronizing planting with neighbouring fields, and removing weeds and volunteer rice that serve as alternate hosts. Regular monitoring is crucial and involves tapping plants to detect hoppers, using light traps to monitor adults, and scouting for signs of \u201chopperburn,\u201d characterized by yellow to brown patches in the field. Chemical control should be used only as a last resort, targeting the base of the plant with specific insecticides such as Ethofenoprox 10% EC at 200-300 ml\/acre or Pymetrozine 50% WG at 120 g\/acre or Dinotefuran 20% SG at 80 g\/acre or Triflumezopyrim 10% SC at 94 ml\/acre or Flonicamid 50% WG at 60 g\/acre or Buprofezin 25% SC at 325 ml\/acre."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control reddish colouration of Paddy leaves?","Final Answer":"The reddish color on paddy leaves can result from several causes, including nutrient deficiencies, fungal or bacterial diseases, and soil-related problems. Identifying the root cause depends on when the symptoms appear, how they look, and the overall condition of the field. Zinc deficiency (Khaira disease) causes bronzing on young leaves and can be controlled by draining the field and applying zinc sulfate (10 kg\/acre) before transplanting, with foliar zinc sprays for severe cases. Phosphorus deficiency shows as reddish tints on older leaves and is managed by applying phosphorus fertilizer early. For bacterial leaf blight, avoid heavy nitrogen, improve drainage, and apply copper oxychloride at 200-300 g\/acre. Brown Spot, another fungal disease, leads to reddish-brown circular lesions that can grow larger and merge, reducing the plant\u2019s photosynthetic ability.

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Paddy leaf discoloration and drying of top leaf?","Final Answer":"The yellowing and drying of the top leaf in paddy, is a symptom that points to a few likely causes. The most common culprits are the Yellow Stem Borer pest, Bacterial Leaf Blight disease, or a Sulphur nutrient deficiency. Correctly identifying the cause is crucial for effective control. Here\u2019s a detailed guide to diagnose and manage each issue. Yellow Stem Borer (causing \"Deadheart\"). This is a very common and likely cause. The damage is not from the outside but from a larva boring inside the plant stem. To control it, use pheromone traps to monitor the adult moth population and determine the right time for intervention. Application of granular insecticides in standing water is highly effective. Cartap Hydrochloride 4G: @ 300 g\/acre, Fipronil 0.3% GR: @ 10 kg\/acre. If the infestation is high, a spray can be used Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC: @ 60 ml\/acre. Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB): The drying starts from the tip and edges (margins) of the leaf, not from the base of the shoot. The lesions are typically yellow with a wavy or irregular margin between the diseased and healthy parts. To control this, avoid excessive use of Nitrogen (Urea) fertilizer. Ensure proper field drainage to reduce humidity. Copper Oxychloride 50% WP @ 200-250 g\/acre. Nutrient Deficiency: Sulphur (S): The most distinct symptom is the uniform pale yellowing (chlorosis) of the younger, upper leaves, while the older, lower leaves remain relatively green. The entire top leaf becomes discolored, but it doesn't typically dry up from the base and cannot be pulled out like a deadheart. To manage this, give a soil application (Preventive): Apply Bentonite Sulphur (8-10 kg\/acre) or Gypsum (80-100 kg\/acre) as a basal dose during land preparation. For a standing crop showing symptoms, a foliar spray is effective. Spray a 1% solution of a water-soluble sulphate fertilizer like Ammonium Sulphate or Potassium Sulphate."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Leaf sucker?","Final Answer":"Leaf suckers in paddy, including green leafhopper, brown planthopper, and whitebacked planthopper, can be effectively managed through an integrated approach. Cultural practices such as applying nitrogen fertilizer in split doses, using resistant varieties, practicing synchronized planting, maintaining a rice-free interval, and removing weeds help reduce pest populations. Encouraging natural predators like spiders and parasitoid wasps supports biological control.

Proper water management, field sanitation, and regular monitoring are essential to prevent severe damage from leaf suckers."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What are the major problems in Paddy cultivation?","Final Answer":"The major problems in paddy cultivation are a complex mix of environmental, biological, and socio-economic challenges. The most critical issues are erratic water availability (both floods and droughts), severe pest and disease pressure, declining soil health with widespread nutrient deficiencies, and significant socio-economic constraints like small landholdings and labor shortages. Water Management (Floods and Droughts): Bihar faces a unique hydro-geological challenge, making water management the primary problem. Floods: North Bihar, crisscrossed by rivers like the Kosi and Gandak, is chronically flood-prone. Every year, a significant area of standing paddy crop is either partially or completely submerged, leading to total crop failure. Droughts: Conversely, South and Central Bihar are susceptible to drought due to erratic monsoon patterns and inadequate irrigation infrastructure. A lack of rainfall during critical stages like transplanting or grain filling can severely reduce yields. Pest and Disease Pressure: The warm, humid conditions during the Kharif (Aman) season are ideal for the proliferation of various pests and diseases. Leafhoppers, planthoppers, stem borers, brown spot, bacterial leaf blight, sheath blight, etc. These reduce yields, quality, cause lodging, or even crop failure in severe cases. Resistance development (or reduced efficacy) to insecticides\/fungicides when used improperly. Soil Health and Nutrient Management: Repeated cropping of rice without adequate replenishment of soil nutrients reduces fertility. Overuse or misuse of fertilizers (especially nitrogen) without balanced nutrients and organic matter leads to problems. Soil salinity\/sodicity issues in some areas. Also, waterlogged soil (from flooding) causes issues with aeration and root health. Socio-Economic Challenges: Small and Fragmented Landholdings: The average farm size in Bihar is very small. This fragmentation makes mechanization difficult, increases labor costs per unit area, and reduces the farmer's ability to invest in infrastructure like irrigation. Labor Shortage: High rates of out-migration from rural Bihar lead to a shortage of agricultural labor during peak seasons like transplanting and harvesting, which drives up wages and can delay critical farm operations. Post-Harvest Losses: Inadequate storage facilities, a lack of local processing units, and inefficient market linkages often force farmers into distress sales at low prices immediately after harvest. Seed Quality \/ Variety Issues: Non-availability of improved, high-yielding, disease\/pest-tolerant varieties of adequate quality. Sometimes farmers use older or local varieties, which may have lower yields or less resistance. Delays in the release or adoption of newer tolerant varieties. High Input Costs & Economic Constraints: Fertilizer, pesticide, and seed costs are rising. Small farmers often find it difficult to afford the inputs required for optimal yields. Returns are sometimes not commensurate with input costs, especially when yields drop. Lack of Technological \/ Extension Support: Inadequate extension on improved techniques (direct sowing, machine transplanting, climate-smart agriculture). Lack of training, lack of awareness of improved practices (e.g., alternate wetting and drying, System of Rice Intensification, etc.). Poor access to credit, insurance, and quality inputs in some areas. "}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How to control Leaf spot in Paddy?","Final Answer":"\"Leaf Spot\" in paddy most commonly refers to Brown Spot, a fungal disease that can significantly impact yield, especially when the crop is under nutrient stress, and correct identification is key to effective management. The disease creates small, oval to circular lesions on the leaves. These spots are initially reddish-brown and can grow larger, developing a grey or whitish center with a reddish-brown margin. In severe cases, the spots merge, causing the entire leaf to dry up, which severely affects the plant's ability to fill the grains. To control this, use high-quality, disease-free certified seeds. Treat seeds with a fungicide like Thiram or Captan before sowing. Ensure a balanced application of fertilizers based on a soil test. Specifically, adequate application of Muriate of Potash (MOP) is crucial, as Potassium deficiency makes the plant highly susceptible to Brown Spot. Keep the field and surrounding bunds free of weeds and crop debris, which can host the fungus. Chemical sprays are recommended when the disease begins to appear. Mancozeb 75% WP @ 600-800 g per acre (PHI 21-28), Propiconazole 25% EC @ 300 ml per acre (PHI 30 days), Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml per acre (PHI 40 days), Tebuconazole + Trifloxystrobin 75% WG @ 80 g per acre (PHI 21 days). These chemicals should be applied as spot treatments with 200\u2013250 liters of water per acre, rotating chemicals to avoid resistance. Always wear protective equipment such as full sleeve clothes, goggles, gloves, and a mask."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How much amount of area is required to raise a Paddy nursery?","Final Answer":"The area required for a paddy nursery varies with the cultivation method and the total area to be planted. For conventional transplanting, a larger nursery is needed\u2014about 225 to 300 square meters per acre of the main field. In comparison, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Modified Mat Nursery methods require much less space, roughly 37.5 square meters per acre. The Dapog Nursery method needs even less, around 9 to 14 square meters per acre. Typically, the nursery area for conventional planting is about 5\u201310% of the total field area because it uses a higher seed rate and older seedlings. SRI and Mat Nursery use fewer seeds and younger seedlings, so they need smaller nurseries. Other factors, such as rice variety and seedling age at transplanting, can also influence the required nursery size."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"Information regarding soil culture","Final Answer":"Paddy cultivation thrives best in clayey or loamy clay soils rich in organic matter and with high water-retention capacity, as rice is typically grown under flooded conditions. Alluvial soils, especially in deltas and floodplains, are highly suitable, while rice can also adapt to red-yellow, black, laterite, and loamy soils, provided water is available. The crop tolerates a wide soil pH range from acidic (5.5\u20136.5) to alkaline. Key soil management practices include puddling, which reduces water loss and controls weeds; laser levelling, which enhances water efficiency and yield; and the use of organic manures like compost or FYM to improve fertility. Incorporating crop residues and green manure crops such as Sesbania (Dhaincha) boosts soil nutrients and structure. Biofertilizers like Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria support nitrogen and phosphorus availability, while attention to micronutrients like zinc and iron is essential under submerged conditions. Sustainable practices such as minimum tillage, crop rotation, and cover cropping help maintain long-term soil health and productivity."}

For the next application cycle, farmers should regularly check the Bihar Agriculture Department website or contact local agricultural offices."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"When to use organic fertilizers in Paddy field?","Final Answer":"Organic fertilizers should be applied as a basal dose during the final land preparation, ideally 1 to 3 weeks before transplanting rice seedlings. This timing allows the organic matter\u2014such as well-decomposed manure, compost, or green leaf manure\u2014to start decomposing and enriching the soil before the young plants grow. If using green manure crops like dhaincha or cowpea, sow them early and incorporate them into the soil about 10\u201315 days before transplanting. Biofertilizers like Azospirillum or phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria can be mixed with compost and added to the soil just before planting. Applying organic fertilizer at this stage is crucial because the nutrients are released slowly, providing steady nourishment throughout the crop\u2019s growth. It also improves soil health by enhancing structure, aeration, and water retention, while reducing nutrient loss by preventing runoff during flooding."}
{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"How many days later should we do transplanting?","Final Answer":"The optimal time to transplant paddy seedlings depends on the rice variety and the age of the seedlings after seeding (DAS). Short-duration varieties should be transplanted between 18 and 22 days, ideally before the 5th leaf stage (around 25 days), as delays can reduce yield. Medium-duration varieties transplant best at 25\u201330 days, while long-duration varieties have an optimal transplant window of 35\u201340 days. Older seedlings (45\u201350 days) may be used if necessary, but they can lower yield due to fewer tillers and longer recovery from transplant shock. To ensure success, check that seedlings have about four leaves, handle them carefully to avoid damage, prepare the field properly with good puddling and shallow water, and transplant 2\u20133 seedlings per hill with appropriate spacing to promote tillering and maximize yield. Delaying transplanting beyond the ideal window can shorten growth periods and reduce grain yield."}

{"QUESTION [by Agri Team]":"What is the use of Azolla?","Final Answer":"Azolla is a freshwater fern that grows in ponds, lakes, swamps, and streams in both tropical and sub-tropical conditions. In association with the blue-green alga Anabaena, Azolla can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) into ammonia, which can be utilized by the rice plant when incorporated into the soil. Azolla contains 2\u22125% N and 0.3\u22126.0% potassium (K) on a dry weight basis. Azolla grows best at an average daily temperature of 25\u202f\u00b0C but dies at higher temperatures. It can be used in rice cultivation during both the wet and dry seasons. There are two main ways to utilize Azolla: As green manure incorporated before transplanting, As an intercrop incorporated after transplanting. Among nutrients, phosphorus (P) is most important for Azolla. Since Azolla floats, it cannot extract P from the soil, and its growth is often constrained by P deficiency if P is not applied to the floodwater. The economics of Azolla use are important. The technology is labor-intensive, and often farmers gain little or no economic advantage compared to chemical fertilizers because the additional costs of labor, land opportunity, irrigation, seed\/inoculum, phosphate, and pesticides can make the use of Azolla uneconomical."}

Transplanting: Seedlings are typically transplanted into the main field when they are 25-30 days old. This places the ideal transplanting window from the last week of June to the end of July. Following this schedule ensures that the crop's water needs are met by the monsoon and that the critical flowering and grain-filling stages occur during favorable weather in September and October. Rabi\/Summer (Boro) Season (Irrigated Crop): Boro paddy is a high-yielding, irrigated crop grown during the dry winter and summer months. Its schedule is determined by temperature. Nursery Sowing: Seeds are sown in the nursery from mid-October to mid-November. Special care, like using plastic covers, is often needed to protect young seedlings from the cold. Transplanting: Seedlings are older (45-60 days) and hardier when transplanted to withstand the cool weather. The ideal transplanting window is from mid-January to mid-February. This timing allows the crop to establish during the cooler months and mature before the extreme heat of late summer."}
